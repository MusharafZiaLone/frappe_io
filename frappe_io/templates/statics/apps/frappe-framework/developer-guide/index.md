To start hacking into Frappe, you must have some understanding of how a
dynamic web application works. There are hundreds of architectures and
frameworks to make web development easier, but at the core there are a few
elements that are important to understand.

ERPNext is built on Frappe which is primarily developed for ERPNext but
can be extended to make similar database driven applications. wnframework uses
Python on the server-side and has a javascript based client for entering data,
managing workflow and making reports.
