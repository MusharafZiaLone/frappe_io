> After trying so many ERP's, what I liked is the completeness and ease of use
of ERPnext. Other ERP’s are very hard to use and learn” At Alcon, people were
used to working on traditional excel / word files. It was difficult to get
everybody to use ERPNext, which was based on an open source platform; However,
they came around when they saw a user-friendly interface.

Ms. Zel believes that Alcon’s strength lies in operating as one team. They are
unified in their front and take decisions as a unified whole. They follow a
few practices which ensures them good business results. Some of their
practices are mentioned below:

  * Prioritize Customer Need: Everyone in Alcon works as one team to prioritize customer needs. They maintain a fair balance between company needs and employee needs. There are times when conflicts and disagreements arise, but they agree to disagree and do what is in the best interest of all.

  * Listen to the customer: They take customer feedback very seriously. They listen and act upon what customers have to say. Based on the bad comments they try to improvise. From the good feedback, they feel motivated and happy to please more.

  * Continuously Prospect: Just because they are leading providers they do not sit back and enjoy their position. They constantly prospect and continue to acquire new clients.

  * Set High Targets: Since they have a tremendous capacity to supply and provide good after- sales-service, they do not hesitate to take more customers. They commit to high targets. They are able to convert more leads when their targets are high.

  * Deal with decision makers: Alcon’s team understands that deals take a long time to close if they prospect the wrong people. Dealing with the decision makers, gives them a high percentage closure.

  * Keeping in touch with customers: Just because they have so many customers and they are good, they do not take their customers for granted. They have processes set, based on which, they regularly communicate with their customers. The module in ERPNext maintains all the communication history with all their clients.

When we asked Ms. Zel, which is her favourite feature in ERPNext? She said,
all of them!
