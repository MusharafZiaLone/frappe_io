Reconciliation is an accounting process used to compare two sets of records to
ensure the figures are in agreement and are accurate. It is the key process
used to determine whether the money leaving an account matches the amount
spent, ensuring the two values are balanced at the end of the recording
period. In Payment Reconciliation, the invoices are matched against the
payments made to the bank. Thus if you have many payments which are not
reconciled with their respective invoices, you can use the payment
reconciliation tool.
