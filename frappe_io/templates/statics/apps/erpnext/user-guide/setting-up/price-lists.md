A Price List is a place where different rate plans can be stored. Itâ€™s a name
you give to a set of Item Prices stored under a particular Price List.

An Item can have multiple prices based on customer, currency, region, shipping
cost etc, which can be stored as different rate plans. In ERPNext, you are
required to store all the lists separately. Buying Price List is different
from Selling Price List and thus is stored separately.
