This manual covers all the major processes in setting up and using ERPNext.
The manual is written in a way that the user can manage a self-implementation
of the ERP. We recommend that the manual be read first before starting
implementation.

The user-guide is divided into different modules. Beginners can start with the Introduction and Setting up module. Advanced Users can go directly to the module and look for help based on the topic. The individual modules have subtopics which inturn have sub-chapters if required.

This guide is aimed at an average business user. To gain conceptual understanding of selected topics, you could read the knowledge-base.
