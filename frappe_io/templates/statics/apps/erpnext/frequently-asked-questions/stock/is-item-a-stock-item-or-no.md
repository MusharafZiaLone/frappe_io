# How To Assess Whether An Item Is A Stock Item Or Not?

Go to the inventory section of the Item form in the stock module to select this option.

> Stock > Item

In ERPNext an Item is a Stock Item when it is countable. Anything that is countable can be stored as a stock Item. The stocks can be raw materials or finished goods. 

An Item is not a stock item, when it is not essential to keep a count of that Item.

__For example:__ In a furniture manufacturing unit, if you order a box of nails, you will not essentially keep a stock of all the individual small nails. Similarly you might order a box of office pins, but you may not individually count them or maintain their stock. In such scenarios, where keeping a count is negligible, you can mention that Item as Non-stock Item.
