# How To Setup Reorder-Level?

Go to the reorder section of the Item form in the stock module.

> Stock > Item

The Re-Order level is the point at which stock on a particular item has diminished to a point where it needs to be replenished. To order based on re-order level can avoid shortages. Re-order level can be determined based on the lead time and the average daily consumption.

__For example:__ You can set your reorder level of bath towels at 10. When there are only 10 towels remaining in stock, the system will either send a mail or take action depending upon what you have selected in global settings.
