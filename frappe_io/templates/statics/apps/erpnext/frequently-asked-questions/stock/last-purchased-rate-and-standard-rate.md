# What Is The Difference Between Last Purchased Rate and Standard Rate?

Go to the Item form and click on the purchase details section. Enter the standard rate accordingly.

> Stock> Item

When you buy your purchases from a supplier you buy at a particular rate. Sometimes the rates change due to different reasons. Thus you can ask your supplier to maintain a standard rate which does not deviate . This rate which is the same and doesnt change every now and then is called the standard rate. When there is no standard rate and the rate keeps changing you can pay based on the rate you paid the last time you purchased from this supplier. This is the ‘Last Purchased Rate’. 

For Example: If the tree glue is Rs 100 per Kg most of the time and if the supplier has made it a standard rate, then you will always buy the tree glue at Rs100/- which is a standard rate. However, in case the supplier sells it at 110 or 100 or 105 at times, the purchaser can use the last purchased rate to do his next payment. so if he payed 105 last time he bought tree glue, 105 will be the Last Purchased Rate.
