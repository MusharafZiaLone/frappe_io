# How To Rename An Item?

There are times when we wish we could have renamed our product differently. At
times like this, ERPNext allows you to make changes to the Item name.

Renaming is basically calling the same product with a different name.

  

**Step 1:** To Rename an Item, open the Item-Master file.   

**Step 2:** Go to the top black bar and click on the word File.

__Step 3:__ A rename box will appear where you can type the new Item Name and click on Rename. Do not check on box 'Merge with existing'. To read what Merge does visit [Merging Documents](merging-documents).

  

> Note:The Item Name  will be renamed but the Item Code and description field will remain the same. 

  

#### Figure 2: Enter New Name

__Step 4:__ Check the output

The name Jute Bag General will be changed to Jute Bag SOG. However, the Item
code and description will remain same.

> Note: Note that the name will change in all the past documents like Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, Invoices etc. The Item code though will be the old one.

The new name is a change in name and thus will retain all the properties of
the old name. It will be the same file with new name.
