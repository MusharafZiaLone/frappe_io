# How To Specify "End of Life"?

To set your product's End-of-Life period, go to the Inventory section of the Item form. Mention the date of expiry for your product.

> Stock > Item

End-of-life (EOL) is a term used with respect to a product supplied to customers, indicating that the product is in the end of its useful life, and a vendor will no longer be marketing, selling, or sustaining it. The vendor may also be limiting or ending support for the product. In the specific case of product sales, the term end-of-sale (EOS) has also been used. The term lifetime, after the last production date, depends on the product and is related to a customer's expected product lifetime. 

__For Example__, Different food products can have different End-of Life dates depending upon its ability to preserve its original taste and form. A packaged cake may have a shelf-life of 1 month. This means that you can mention its ‘End-of-life’ as the date which is one month after the date of manufacturing. Similarly, cakes made at a bakery without air-tight packing may have its End-of-Life date after 2 days of manufacturing it.
