#### How to allocate allowance percent?

Go to the Item form in stock module to make this allocation.

> Stock > Item > 

In the process of manufacturing an Item there is a possibility of percentage variation in quantity. This percentage variation in quantity is termed as allowance percent. Thus you can mention the allowance percent that is allowed while receiving or delivering this item.

__For example,__ If you are manufacturing and packing rice powder, you can mention 5% as allowance percent, since 5% gets wasted in packing and repacking.
