#### How to assess whether an Item is a stock Item or not?

Go to the inventory section of the Item form in the stock module to select this option.

> Stock > Item

Stock Items are products which the company stores in their warehouses. The stocks can be either raw materials or finished goods. In case they are raw materials, they are stocked to manage manufacturing without wasting time in last minute purchases. The finished goods are stocked in order to provide supplies to retailers and distributors on demand.

An Item is not a stock item, when it is outsourced or purchased and not stored . It could be an item which is bought and sold based on demand.

__For example,__ a custom goods order is not a stock Item. If a customised bed cum wardrobe is manufactured based on the design specification of the customer, the product will be manufactured and delivered. There is no point in stocking this Item.
