A minimum order quantity is the minimum order size accepted by a supplier. Generally, this is based on the minimum order the supplier needs in order for the transaction to be profitable for them. Sometimes they may accept smaller orders for a higher price per unit. With most suppliers, the more you order, the greater your discount.

__For example:__ A Jute cloth supplier who refuses to supply half meter jute has a minimum order quantity set as 1 meter. He doesn’t wish to sell half meter or less than that, because that is not profitable.
