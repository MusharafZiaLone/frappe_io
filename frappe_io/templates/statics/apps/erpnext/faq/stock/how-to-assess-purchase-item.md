# How To Assess Whether An Item Is A Purchase Item Or Not ? 

Go to the stock page and open a new Item form. In the ‘Purchase Detail’ section you will get an option to choose whether your product is purchase Item or not.

> Stock > Item

An Item will be a purchase Item if it is not manufactured in-house. If you are required to buy the product from outside, it will be a purchased item.

__For Example:__ If you sell a product Jute Bag with a flower patch work, and if you buy the flower patch work directly from a vendor ; your flower patch work will be a Purchase Item. The Jute Bag will not be a purchase Item since it will be manufactured in-house by the company.
