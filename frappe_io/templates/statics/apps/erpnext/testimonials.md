*"So you guys at ERPNext already have very good vision of what a complete preferred ERP package should be for the market. Maybe the difference is just that OpenERP have more backups, more people and more sponsors. But their applications are heavy weight and slower than ERPNext. The market is very open for SMB."*

*"I want to say that your support has been absolutely fantastic. I've  raised a number of tickets and I don't think a single one has gone longer than a business day without receiving a response (and I understand that we are in very different time zones, too). It's really nice to know you guys are actively working on the software and keeping an eye on customers too. (Also our entire company loves the idea of open source, it's great to see).
Thanks for your prompt attention on the issue, you guys are great."*
