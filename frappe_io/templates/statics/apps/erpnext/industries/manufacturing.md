### Introduction

Manufacturing Industry is facing stiff competition from global units. The pressure to reduce costs and be optimal, is mounting as days pass by. Consumers are demanding more and are willing to change brands for a better and cost-effective product.

In a situation like this, innovation and willingness to adopt new paradigms can accelerate productivity. One step towards change could be installing a dedicated ERP system that can address specific problems of a  manufacturing industry.

ERPNext  provides a high level view of the manufacturing operations, showing each department’s position to facilitate resource allocation and the planning of production schedules.

### Manufacturing Management

1. **Calculate Production Costs:** The Bill of Materials (BoM) form gives the total cost of manufacturing or acquiring an Item at a glance and determines the valuation of that product.
2. **Prepare Multi-level Bill of Materials:** Manage hierarchical Bill of Materials and Operations for all sub-assemblies and final assemblies. Calculate resulting production costs.
3. **Plan for Material Shortages:** The data captured in the BoM form provides accurate information needed for scheduling material requirements.
4. **Make Production Plans:** Use existing Sales Orders and plan for material procurement and operations management.
5. **Make Material Requirements Plan (MRP):** Automatically determine material required to complete a Production Plan based on Requested, Ordered, Available and Reserved Stock.
6. **Release and Close Production Work Orders:** For each item, build and review material consumed for production and back-flush inventory on closing.
7. **Purchase and Supply Chain Management:** Raise Material Requests. Users across other departments can raise material requests and purchase orders as per their requirements. 
8. **Improve Inter-departmental Coordination:** Delays in placing purchase orders can be reduced by raising material requests as per the order bookings and sporadic demands in product requisitions.
9. **Multi-Currency Currency:** Raise Purchase Orders in supplier’s currency as well as your company’s currency based on an exchange rate.
10. **Pricing:** You can design and store different price lists based on currency, location, customers and suppliers.
11. **Configure Taxes and Tax Templates:** Different types of taxes like VAT, CENVAT, Purchase Tax, Sales Tax, Shipping Costs etc. can be configured and attached to a purchase or a sale.
12. **Track Pending Orders:** Orders which are not delivered by the suppliers can be tracked easily. Mechanism for sending reminders to suppliers and maintaining their communication history is available in ERPNext.
13. **Avoid Out-of-Stock:** Material requests help you to identify items you need to purchase and can be created by manual entry, from a Production Plan or automatically, from an item that crosses its re-order level.
14. **Prevent Oversupply:** Set limits on oversupply and overbilling and get warnings if the Supplier is billing at a different rate or quantity.
15. **Manage Sub-Contracted Products:** In scenarios where you supply the raw-material to the sub-contractor, you can ensure that the right amount of material is sent and consumed.
16. **Calculate Landed Costs:** Spread expenses over a number of Purchase Invoices retroactively, in cases where you get billed after a period of time.
17. **Inspect Incoming Quality:** Keep a record of sampling measurements on incoming Items from your suppliers.

### Inventory and Warehouse Management

1. **Setup Multiple Warehouses:** In ERPNext you can configure multiple warehouses for multiple products. Separate warehouses for finished goods and unfinished goods can be maintained. A workstation or warehouse for goods in production or assimilation can be provided.
1. **Automate Accounting of Stock Transactions:** Perpetual Inventory system will make it easier for you to maintain accuracy of company's assets and expenses. Stock balances will always be in sync with relevant account balances. It is a more accurate alternative to manually making periodic entries to balance accounts.
1. **Record Stock Movements:** Move items from and to various warehouses and "back-flush" inventory based on Bill of Materials.
1. **Perform Stock Valuation:** First-In-First-Out (FIFO) or Moving Average. Make backdated entries and the system will forward-calculate relevant valuations.
1. **Create Backdated Stock Transactions:** Future Stock Ledger Entries and General Ledger Entries get recalculated for all products of that transaction. Cancellations or amendment of existing transactions can be managed easily. 
1. **Monitor Warranty and Traceability:** Maintain a database of unique Serial Numbers for products that require traceability. Keep track of warranties for multiple maintenance contracts.
1. **Manage Batch Inventory:** Create batches of products and track their expiration and other related information.
1. **Use Point-of-Sale:** Update inventory, accounting ledgers and payments, all in a simple Point-of-Sales (POS) interface [link].
