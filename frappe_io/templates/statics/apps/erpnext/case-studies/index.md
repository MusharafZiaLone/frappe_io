# Case studies

Casestudies have small booklets written on topics of general interest to the customers. These booklets have user information  on how to run ERPNext cycles based on specific case-examples. The Case-studies have detail documentation and can supplement the existing user manual.

For Example, the case-study “Make- To- Order” has a case-example of how a product, pen-stand, is manufactured after receiving a Sales Order. 

Similarly, the other case-studies are explained with the help of realistic case-examples.
