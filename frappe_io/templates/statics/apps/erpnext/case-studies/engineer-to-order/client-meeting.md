# Client Meeting


In this phase a lot of discussion takes place to confirm the design of the final product. The company gives a quotation to the client based on the primary design and the cost estimate of the product. The showroom supervisor explains to the client that the custom design products are sometimes dependent on the availability of the raw material. He gives different design options to the client and notes down the specific requirements of the customer. At this stage it is possible to make as many quotations as you wish to. In ERPNext you can cancel the old quotation and amend them.

After the client meeting, enter the customer details into the system.

### Customer 
 
A customer, who is sometimes known as a client, buyer, or purchaser is the one who receives goods, services, products, or ideas, from a seller for a monetary consideration. A customer can also receive goods or services from a vendor or a supplier for other valuable considerations.

In this example, customer is Ms. Jane Dsouza. Visit [Customer](/apps/erpnext/user-guide/selling/customer-master) to understand in detail.
