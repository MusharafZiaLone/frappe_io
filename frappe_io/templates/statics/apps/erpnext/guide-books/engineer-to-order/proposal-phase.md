# Proposal Phase

### Quotation

This is the initial quote that is presented to the customer, for approval of design and the cost of the product.

The first quotation is given to the client, Jane D’souza. She visits a few more custom furniture makers and takes quotations from them. She realises that there is a scope of margin to negotiate. So she comes back and asks for another quotation. The showroom supervisor gives her a second quote. He says he can give her the same product, but instead of special plywood, he will use the standard plywood. He assures her that the local plywood maker is very reliable. He also assures her that most clients prefer this plywood since it brings down the total cost and is good in quality.

The sales engineer then revises the bill of materials and prepares a new quotation.

In ERPNext, you can delete/cancel the existing submitted Quotation and amend it. Mention the new rate with the new design description.

In order to print your Quotation as Proforma Invoice, go to print heading in the Quotation’s  info section. Select proforma Invoice as your new print heading and save. The printout will have a heading as Pro-forma Invoice.

### Proforma Invoice

However, you can term the Quotation as Proforma Invoice and bill the client in phases. A proforma invoice is a document that is sent to a buyer in certain circumstances - usually before all of the invoice details are known. A Proforma Invoice is not a true invoice – it is simply a document that declares the seller’s commitment to provide the goods or services specified to the buyer at certain prices. Proforma invoices are not recorded as an accounts receivable by the seller nor are they recorded as an accounts payable by the buyer.


> Setup > Printing > A Print Heading

To print the name Proforma Invoice on the Quotation, create a Print Heading in ERPNext Account.

Now go to Quotation and Change the Print Heading Name.

Jane realises that if she wants a further decrease in price, the furniture maker will offer further non-branded raw material and decrease cost. She doesn't want to compromise on quality and thus agrees to the second quote. She confirms the order and pays them Rs. 10000/- as Advance.
