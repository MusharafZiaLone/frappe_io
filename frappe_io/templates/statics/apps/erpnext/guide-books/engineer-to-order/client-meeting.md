# Client Meeting

In engineer to order companies, a deal goes through multiple stages of discussions and back and forth. At each stage, you will need to prepare new proposals and new costing for the product. In ERPNext, you create.

1. **Item** codes for the finished product.
1. A **Bill of Materials** for estimating the cost, which can be amended.
1. A **Quotation**, that is a proposal for a product or group of products.

To create **Quotations**, you will have to create a **Lead** or a **Customer** first.

### Customer

A customer, who is sometimes known as a client, buyer, or purchaser is the one who receives goods, services, products, or ideas, from a seller for a monetary consideration. A customer can also receive goods or services from a vendor or a supplier for other valuable considerations.

In this example, customer is Ms. Jane Dsouza. Visit [Customer](/apps/erpnext/user-guide/selling/customer-master) to understand in detail.
