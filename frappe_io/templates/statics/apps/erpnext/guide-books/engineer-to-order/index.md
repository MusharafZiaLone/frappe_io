# Engineer To Order

For this study, a furniture making company is featured. With the help of a example, the whole process of making a sales order to manufacturing the product along with billing the customer, is explained in detail.

### Introduction

**Engineer-to-order:** Engineer-to-order manufacturing is a strategy where the product is designed and manufactured based on very specific customer requirements. Since the end product tends to be complex, customers may engage with the ETO company throughout the entire design and manufacturing phases, to ensure that their specifications are met. This strategy is used by construction, fabrication industry, furniture industry etc.

Since most specifications like design, requirements, engineering changes etc are often tossed back and forth several times between the company and the customer, either party can become confused if the exchange of product information is poorly managed. Managing and identifying parts for production is an important step.

Engineered-to-order products are often built from difficult to source parts, expensive parts and highly engineered components. Thus, acquiring the necessary product components can be a time consuming and costly endeavor, causing issues before and during production runs.

#### Case Example

Supreme Furniture is a small furniture making company that deals in all-types of furniture. They have a small showroom, where they keep some samples. However, they produce only after a customer confirms the order and gives their specifications clearly.

Supreme Furniture receives a client who is keen on making a multipurpose bed for her daughter. She wishes for a bed that would have lot of storage units, has no sharp edges, and has provision for drawers. She also wishes that the bed would have an attached wardrobe to it.
