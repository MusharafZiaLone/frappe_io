ERPNext has users over the world and here is a small repository of stories
shared by our users.

In this section, we try to capture the business practices followed by small
and mid-sized companies. Some stories narrate their start-up experiences,
their challenges and successes while others specify functional best practices.

If you wish to be a part of these interview case stories, mail
priya@iwebnotes.com. We would love to call you and schedule an appointment for
discussion!
