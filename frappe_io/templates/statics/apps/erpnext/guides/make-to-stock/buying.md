After completing the Bill of Materials, go to the Buying module to purchase raw material. To manufacture butterfly print bags, as per the BOM, there is a need to buy jute cloth with butterfly print and 150 handles. Since one bag requires 1 meter jute cloth, for 150 bags we will require 150 meter jute cloth.  Thus it is essential to procure 150 jute handles and 150 meter jute cloth.
