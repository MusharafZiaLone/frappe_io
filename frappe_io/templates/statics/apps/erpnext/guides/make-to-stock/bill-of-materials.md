### Definition

A bill of materials [BOM] is a list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts and the quantities of each needed to manufacture an end product.

Making these butterfly print bags requires only two operations. One, to stitch the bag with butterfly printed jute cloth and second, to fix jute handles in the loops made for them.
These steps will be mentioned in the BOM operations steps along with the material required for each step.
