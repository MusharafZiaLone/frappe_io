Shades of Green produces Jute Bags in advance. These bags are sold at exhibitions like over- the- counter products. The jute bags are stored in the company warehouse and sent from time-to-time to the distributors and retailers. They do not wait for the customers to place a bag order and then manufacture it.  
__Note:__ Production orders are issued based on forecasts, not based on sales orders.
