Payment Entry is a part of booking-keeping. To be able to record accounts and manage balance sheets, payment entries are requisites.

### Double Entry Accounting

Double entry bookkeeping is a system of accounting in which every transaction has a corresponding positive and negative entry : debits and credits. Every transaction involves a debit entry in one account and a credit entry in another account. This means that every transaction must be recorded in two accounts; one account will be debited because it receives value and the other account will be credited because it has given value.

Once the Invoice is submitted. Click on the drop-down- Action button and enter on Make Payment  Entry. A Journal Voucher appears with debit and credit entries. Make sure to click on the button that says ‘Make Difference Entry’. On this document, reference number and reference date is mandatory. Account entry is mandatory too. In case for some reason, the account section is blank, it means that you have not selected your default bank account. If you have confusion on where to post what, click on the triangle button next to the Company to set the default master account.

The click will take you to the Master-Company file. Now enter your default entry account as HDFC Bank/Axis Bank etc and Save. This will enable the system to post debit/credit entries directly against this particular account.
