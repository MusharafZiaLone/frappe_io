# What Inspires Us?

### 37Signals

We just love [37Signals](http://37signals.com/) and their philosophy of working, not to mention their products which are just amazing. We think that they, and not SalesForce, are the true pioneers of web applications. What is even more surprising is that after all these years, they remain as fresh and thought provoking as usual. Our product and design owes a lot to them.

### Sal Khan And Khan Academy

Few people have single handedly created a revolution like [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org/) has done for education. Sal Khan has also defied conventions in very interesting ways. He did not employ an army of people to make his videos. He created close to 3000 videos, using his own personal skills and technology. Being a non-profit, he was able to make a great team and also get support from some of the world best foundations. And he is an amazing role model for South Asians.

### Apple

I know we are sounding cliched, but its just not Steve Jobs. We think that Apple is Apple because what is beautiful on the outside is beautiful inside too. One cannot just take the external appeal of Apple and replicate that. They have set the benchmark of engineering (yes they beat the Germans and the Swedes) and we hope we can understand and use some of their focus and attention to detail.
