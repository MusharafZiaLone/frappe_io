"","2012-a-tough-year","2012 A tough Year for Startups?","rushabh","","<p>I have this nasty feeling that 2012 is going to very tough for startups, specially in India. Here are my reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Low Hanging Fruit is Gone: We are at the end of phase I of internet revolution and industries that were ripe for innovation like media, travel, classifieds, gaming (and to an extent retail, specially books) have been the focus of startup attention for too long now.</li>
<li>No Innovation: True innovation (of the scale of Google) will happen in places like Silicon Valley and Boston due to high the quality of mentorship and early adopters. It is extremely unlikely that a startup in India will do very innovative work. </li>
<li>Recruitment: It will be even harder to recruit, because e-commerce players will be consolidating and will compete for talent. Just read an article that venture investments in India have hit a record in 2011. A lot of money has already been poured into these companies and they have no option but to fight for talent. Those large companies (esp in retail) left behind, will also start investing in web platforms. Moreover, the listed IT companies are still flush with funds.</li>
<li>Startup Backlash: There has been a glut of startups in the last 2/3 years and very few seem to be succeeding. Of those still in business, I am not sure how many would survive without venture / angel / parent company funds. Most of the risk takers have already taken on too much risk.</li>
<li>Early Adopter Fatigue: Even the die-hard early adopter will be battling fatigue at the moment. There are just too many tools and too many new things to consider. Doing a startup at this time would mean, battling for the little attention and energy that remains.</li>
<li>The Empire Strikes Back: Corporates are now fully awake to the social media wave, startups will have to compete for space to get heard and noticed. For example, in the ERP space that I follow, SAP has been investing heavily in social media and gets a lion’s share of coverage on forums and news sharing sites because of their muscle.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think 2013 may be a better year, because a lot of the wreckage will have been cleared in 2012 and there may be new opportunities showing up.</p>

"","a-classic-week","A Classic Week","akhilesh","All that happens in a week for a new recruit at ERPNext.","<h4>First Project</h4>
<p>I had just submitted my first project i.e. ""Backup Manager"" and I was waiting for it to go live. I was also wondering what would be my next project. Since it was a new feature, it is a practice at ERPNext that before making it online, we test it for atleast a week and check that the backups are getting uploaded at proper destination. On the first day of live testing, the project failed to upload the backup. We caught the error and fixed it. This continued for more four more days. Finally on 5th day the ""Backup Manager"" uploaded the backup at proper destination and test was successful.</p>
<h4>GitHub</h4>
<p>This week I also learnt about GitHub. GitHub is a huge platform to host open-source projects and you will be surprised to know that till now I was unaware of it. I think every developer should be aware of GitHub. I learned how to setup GitHub on local machine, fork a repository, setting upstream, pull data from repository, pull data from upstream, push data to respository, sending pull request. To make changes in the upstream master or forked repository, first we have to add modified files, commit it and then push it in our fork. Sending pull request is the next step which will request upstream to accept your changes and update in their database.</p>
<p>It really seems confusing up front, but it seems like a great way of learning.</p>
<h4>Life at Web Notes</h4>
<p>Now let me share a small story which I found interesting. The story is about two magical words ""Sahi Hai"" (Its awesome!). Every member in company has developed habit of saying ""Sahi Hai"". Whenever I submitted my work or at the time of asking queries I was appreciated and at the end they told me ""Sahi Hai"". I thought I was performing above their expectations and that's why they are praising me in that manner.</p>
<p>But in a few days I realised that it &nbsp;has became their habit to say those two words to everyone after any conversation. Even if I commit a mistake they say, ""Sahi Hai, this is your initial stage of learning, keep going on"". The fever is widely spread and everyone is infected by it. Currently i'm enjoying the showers of appreciation in this environment. It really boosts up my confidence :)</p>
<p>All I want to say to my colleagues is ""Sahi Hai"".</p>","2013-03-22",1,"Inside ERPNext"
"","a-critical-look-at","A Critical Look at the SAAS / Cloud Model. Will it End before it Starts?","rushabh","","<p>(Warning: This is going to be a loaded post. But I think there are some interesting arguments)</p>

<p>I was reading this wonderful article on NYTimes.com about writing on Architecuture that was about, why the contemporary writing on Architecture is too timid and uncritical (or too dense and gibberish). It also had a subtle take on information overload and why we have no deep insight.</p>

<p>Cloud and SAAS have been heralded as the next big thing in enterprise / SMB computing. Even critics who were initially worried about the security are diminishing against the PR onslaught of large software companies. We clearly bought the kool-aid. If I were to take a critical look at SAAS / Cloud what would I think?</p>

<p>Taking a long term perspective, if you see how technology and industry landscapes change over time, you will find that it alternates between distributed systems and centralization. As a new technology starts developing, there is a wave of centralization, as the early movers have huge advantage and the know-how is concentrated in a few organizations. The economy of scale benefits the organization that has the know-how to offer the new service at even lower price points. Then the technology matures, the know-how spreads to more people and the power of the center reduces.</p>

<p>Take high speed transportation. As the industrial revolution took unfolded, the railway (a central system) enabled more people to travel than ever before. It was so much better than any non-mechanical way of transport. But as the internal combustion engine technology matured, automobiles were developed that let people control their own transport. Air transport, today it is in the hands of a few central airlines because the technology has not progressed to such a level that everyone can have their own flight.</p>

<p>In software, look at Operating Systems. After staying in the hands of a small number of organizations for many years, thanks to Linux, today the know-how has spread and there are so many flavors of operating systems. Just take a look at the way energy, electronic control and food (kitchen gardening), education (Khan Academy) is evolving. Look at the explosion of Fonts for example. After living in tyranny of Arial and Times, today designers have so many fonts to choose from. There seems to be a wave of decentralization going on in those fields.</p>

<p>Cloud is your classic central system. What is enabling it are three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Know-how / technology / bandwidth of hosting a server on the internet is limited. (Infrastructure-as-a-service)</li>
<li>Setting up and maintaining software stacks and virtualization is hard (Platform-as-a-service)</li>
<li>Cost of software licensing (for customers) and piracy (for publishers) are too high. (Software-as-a-service)</li>
</ol>

<p>Let us look how technology is evolving on all these fronts.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Infrastructure: You need redundancy that is expensive and makes sense to centralize. Unless more people set up their own boxes in house, and Static IPs are more easily available, this is hard to do.</p></li>
<li><p>Platform: These days, setting up a linux server is ridiculously easy. Any software developer worth his salt can do this. Just take any stable distro and most of the packages are pre-installed and whatever else you need is a ""yum"" or ""apt-get"" away. I think platform-as-a-service companies will have a tough time because what they offer is not so hard for someone to learn.</p></li>
<li><p>Software as a service: Today, Open Source is blossoming in the start-up world. To get excited, just have a look at GitHub and Hacker News. Or look at Wordpress, Mozilla, RedHat, Ruby on Rails / Django, Twitter Bootstrap etc. Licencing is not an issue anymore, specially with companies like us (ERPNext).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When you look at all this together, you wonder if the Cloud hype is really worth it? Ideally for a software developer should be able to host a software like ERPNext, on vanilla infrastructure quite easily. Then what should be the ideal pricing for it?</p>

<p>We have firmly been in the SAAS world for the last 2 years and though we have not been very successful but things are looking up. Thinking about this makes me nervous. SAAS certainly makes it easy for a certain segment, who want running hot water. As we make our plan ahead, should we jump into the distributed Open Source world or stick to our guns with centralized SAAS / Cloud world?</p>

<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>Did you know that a toaster consists of about four hundred components? Yet, it is one of the simplest devices out there. The modern world is highly sophisticated. It has complex problems like insurgency, economy, climate change, banking, etc. What's
    more, such problems also evolve with time. How do you deal with such problems? Tim Harford urges us to apply nature's algorithm to find innovative solutions - to try different things and select what works - to adapt.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<blockquote>Producing a sweet, fizzy drink is a static solved problem. No further experimentation is necessary, and it is perfectly possible to set uniformly high standards in the production of Coca-Cola.</blockquote>
<div>However, such 'Coca-Cola problems', as he calls them, are increasingly rare in a rapidly changing world. He enlists three essential steps to successful adaptation:</div>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;"">To try new things, with the expectation that some will fail</span>
        </li>
        <li><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;"">To make failure survivable, because it will be common</span>
        </li>
        <li><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;"">And to make sure that you know when you've failed</span>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>He guides us through the requirements for adaptation - conflict, variation and selection, using numerous anecdotes and analogies. He recounts the story of Peter Palchinsky, differences between US strategies for the wars in Vietnam and Iraq, the 'Skunk
    Works' experiment that gave birth to the Supermarine Spitfire - a fighter plane that played a crucial role in World War II and the importance of charter cities like Shenzhen and New Songdo, where innovation can be carried out in isolation. In selection,
    he also highlights the problems of patents as a reward, and argues that prizes are a better alternative to motivate innovation.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>Since failure is an expected outcome of a trial, it is imperative to be able to survive it. Comparing our financial system with nuclear power plants and oil rigs, he urges us to have safety systems in place, so that when the dominoes do fall, the various
    parts of the system are sufficiently decoupled to not come crashing down on each other.
<div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<blockquote>It should have been possible to let both Lehman and AIG collapse without systemic damage.</blockquote>
</div>
<div>So far, the book was very informative, though a bit dry. To me, the situations described made sense only in hindsight. I couldn't relate to it. However, the book took a turn in the final 40 pages. Tim puts light on the characteristics of adaptive organizations
    using examples like Whole Foods, Timpson, W. L. Gore, Google and Virgin. The ideas are relevant for most organizations and the knowledge of the previous 200 pages helps you accept such ideas. In the chapter - Adapting and you, he tells us the story of
    Twyla Tharp's attempt to create a new kind of show - a combination of ballet and musical. Here, he elucidates how difficult it is to realize that you've failed. Her journey from identifying failure, surviving it, making changes and finally, the success
    at Broadway, encompasses the essentials of adaptation.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>In the context of ERPNext, this paragraph really hits the mark.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<blockquote>Disruptive innovations are disruptive precisely because the new technology doesn't appeal to the traditional customers: it is different and for their purposes, it's inferior. But for a small niche of new customers the new disruptive product is exactly
    what is needed. They want smaller, cheaper hard drives, or cameras that produce digital files, or email that you can access on any computer - and they are willing to tolerate the fact that the new product is inferior to the old one along all the traditional
    dimensions. That foothold in the niche market gives the new technology an opportunity to develop into a true threat to the old way of doing things.</blockquote>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>ERP implementation requires a thorough understanding of operations of all departments. It is a complex problem and hence, could benefit from the ideas of this book. There is a possibility that you will fail in your first attempt. But due to open source
    ERPs like ERPNext, such an attempt does not dig a hole in your pocket. And, if you succeed, you would know that you have adapted, you have risen.</div></div>","2013-09-02",1,"Book Reviews"

"","architects-and-craftsmen","Architects and Craftsmen","rushabh","","<p>In traditional sense, an architect is one who can visualize the final building (or product) in its form and structure. It is a job that not only seeks to find creative solutions to the requirements (like space etc) but also make the solution relevant to the society, its trends and aspirations. The architect is a celebrated profession, of an innovator who sees things differently, has empathy and the smarts to come up with creative solutions.</p>

<p>A craftsman on the otherhand is one who brings those dreams into reality. The person who details out the drawings or smoothens out the surfaces or scrapes out sharp edges. The crafsman lives in detail, has a lot of patience and perseverence. The craftsman lives a lowly existence compared to the architect. Even though he / she may also have the creative mind to come up with the designs, is quite satisfied in finishing up the job.</p>

<p>So what happens when the tools of the craftsman change dramatically for the better? If the tools were to make it extremely easier for the craftsman to do the job, will the architect become a craftsman and vice-versa? This is what is happening in the field of software development at the moment. The tools are changing very fast and it is no longer possible for anyone who wishes to be on the top, to remain only a craftsman or only an architect.</p>

<p>How do we adopt in an ever changing landscape? In such a landscape, one must keep experimenting. It is no point sticking to a particular solution, when its relevance will soon be in question. Other strategy is to break things down to their minimalist form and start from first-principles. This way the cost of each experiment will also be reduced and the solution will remain true to its function.</p>

"","budgeting-in-erpnext-using-cost-centers","Budgeting in ERPNext using Cost Centers","nabin","Its always a good idea to plan for expenses ahead of time using Cost Center Budgeting","<p><em>&ldquo;Darling! let&rsquo;s go to the R-Mall tonight and have a dinner there&rdquo;, I asked while talking with my wife during the office lunch time.</em></p>
<p><em>She replied with a joy, &ldquo;Wow! that&rsquo;ll great. Any special occasion?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Oh yeah! my bank account credited by my salary. And remember to look up the specification of that camera we were thinking of buying&rdquo;, I told her.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Remember the outstanding bill of our credit card, it&rsquo;s around 20k. We have not invested a single rupee in last three months. I think we should not go there and do not buy that expensive camera now&rdquo;, she replied sadly.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ok honey. This is the only large expense this month and the camera is an asset for lifetime. And I promise, I will invest the entire amount after our monthly expenses&rdquo;, I told her to calm down.</em></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p>That is the story repeats every month, I do not invest at the beginning of the month. Then I buy something costly, which makes my account empty. Recently I started to write down all the expenses in my diary. That gives me a fair idea about my expenses at the end of the month. But when I look at those figures, I am alarmed. I have nothing to do, except promising myself, not to do that much expenses from next month.</p>
<p>I guess its not only me, the same might true for a lot of people. It not only happens with our personal expenses, also applicable for business expenses. We do not estimate our expenses at the beginning of the month/year. We just take a call before doing an expense, which most cases biased by our urge for instant gratification. It is only at the end of the year, we realize that how much we have spent.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Above is true for &ldquo;ERPNext&rdquo; users as well, very small set of users use &ldquo;Accounting Budget&rdquo; feature to manage their expenses, just making a guess based on interests shown and queries raised by our customers on that topics.</p>
<p>Most of our users are from small and medium sized companies, do not have enough data/expertise/time to predict future expenses. If that is the case, I will suggest them to start based on last year expense figures.</p>
<p>I hope, that is not the case, and the issue is the usability of ERPNext. The budgeting feature is not easily accessible, there are no links in the module home page and no online help available. Sorry, we will try to fix those usability issues in the near future, but here is a quick guide to start using budget.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>You can allocate a budget on any expense account, for a particular cost center.</p>
<p>To allocate budget, go to Accounts &gt; Chart of Cost Centers and edit the cost center for which you want to allocate budget.</p>
<p><img src=""files/budget1.png"" class=""with-shadow"" /></p>
<p>There will find a section called Budget, in the table, enter expense account and budgeted amount for the selected fiscal year.</p>
<p><img src=""files/budget2.png"" class=""with-shadow"" /></p>
<p>If you want monthly budgeting to account for seasonality, create &ldquo;Budget Distribution&rdquo; record from Accounts module home page and select that record in the cost center.</p>
<p>Great, whats next? What will happen when your expense exceeds the allocated budget? You can set that too, whether system should stop the transaction or leave a warning message or just ignore it. Set that instructions in the Company master.</p>
<p><img src=""files/budget3.png"" class=""with-shadow"" /></p>
<p>Anytime, you can increase/decrease your allocated budget, and it can be restricted to a particular role/user as well. There is a report called &ldquo;Budget Variance Report&rdquo;, in which you can check &ldquo;actual expenses&rdquo; vs &ldquo;allocated budget&rdquo; anytime.</p>
<p>Is not that cool? I am thinking to use &ldquo;ERPNext&rdquo;, to track my personal expenses and get a control over them by defining a budget.

Do not think you will apply it in one department and then duplicate it for another, after some time. This kind of approach will take you a long-long time to build an ERP culture. Employees may also think that management is not clear in their thoughts and hence doing a pilot project .

Just like there are Champions, Black Belts, Green Belts* and project team members in a Six-Sigma deployment plan, create your own levels of ERP certified members. The Champion is responsible for getting all the sanctions and permissions. The Black Belts lead the project and spearhead the teams.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0.35cm"">Buy an iPhone because it looks
classy and raise your prestige in society. I think it is the only
feature left for Apple to sell iPhone other than excellent touch
sensitivity. And for me the person with an iPhone is like the owner’s
pocket is filled with ample of money to waste for.  Maybe you find me
fool but trust me I will tell you the various y’s we should not buy
an iPhone.</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style=""margin-bottom: 0.35cm""><b>No File Manager</b> – Why I
	should buy a phone when I cannot place my files according to me. I
	find this as the biggest shame for iOS makers. Whatever the reason
	is for not introducing the File Manager, but it is the biggest con
	of iOS.</p>
	</li><li><p style=""margin-bottom: 0.35cm""><b>No Internet : No Phone</b> – Let
	me tell you clearly if your iPhone is not connected to Internet it
	is as good as the phone with 1/10<sup>th</sup> of its price. If
	iPhone users are proud of their apps then I’m really sorry to say
	that there is no way of installing apps without internet. So first I
	should empty my pocket for buying iPhone and then I should pay
	internet bills till the phone’s life. Good trick to earn money.</p>
	</li><li><p style=""margin-bottom: 0.35cm""><b>No Bluetooth Sharing over
	non-Apple Devices</b> – Bluetooth connectivity is limited to iPhone –
	iPhone. How can iOS makers forgot the 2<sup>nd</sup> most important
	work of human i.e. socializing, I mean information sharing. How can
	I transfer any file via Bluetooth to non-iPhone user.</p>
	</li><li><p style=""margin-bottom: 0.35cm""><b>No sharing even with non-Apple computer</b> –
	Just unbelievable that I cannot insert media or files in iPhone even
	if I have a non-Apple computer. Yes I can download the files from
	iPhone but cannot upload it. Uploading any file to iPhone is a mess
	even from Apple Computer. I think it follows the toughest method to
	insert a file. iTunes is compulsory needed to do such stuff which
	raises dependency. So if you don’t have internet and still want to
	listen to your fav music then you have to buy an Apple computer
	which cost twice the price of iPhone.</p>
	</li><li><p style=""margin-bottom: 0.35cm""><b>Only MP4 videos support</b> –
	Please clap for one more disadvantage of iPhone that it only
	supports MP4 videos. What if my personal video is in .3gp, .flv or
	.mpeg format. iPhone tells me that it not supported to play such
	files.</p>
	</li><li><p style=""margin-bottom: 0.35cm""><b>Cannot set my favorite ringtone</b>
	– Please you are free to laugh loudly because iPhone doesn’t
	even allow you to set a customized ringtone. Instead of listening
	that “Tring Tring” I would prefer a song or a voice recording
	while a call arrives.</p>
</li></ol>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0.35cm"">And still iPhone users say that all
these measures are taken to tighten the security. If iPhone is so
secured then it should be uncrackable. I say don’t give me that
hell again because personally I have cracked iPhone, the term is
known as “JailBreaking”. Dear iPhone users please do not
JailBreak your iPhone until it is under warranty period. The time you
crack it you lose your warranty. And I bet the Apple company and the
iPhone users over the globe that they cannot use iPhone as
conveniently as I can do in Windows, then why should I buy Apple
computer.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0.35cm"">iPhone users are very proud of their
apps, they commit that the apps iPhone have, cannot be found on other
devices. Then please answer why people buy an iPhone before 2012 when
it simply can’t open my documents, spreadsheets &amp;
presentations. Later it was possible by an app “Office Plus”
where you can read &amp; write your documents, it means before 2012
it was impossible to achieve this in iPhone. With these you can
clearly get the progress status of iPhone.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0.35cm""><a name=""_GoBack""></a>Also let me
make you aware that the iOS apps are too bulky. Even a simplest app
would take a good amount of space in your memory. And iPhone lacks
memory card slot so we can’t even extend memory. And now I’m
tired of explaining you the cons of iPhone. It seems like the list
will never ending. So now let me introduce you the solution for iOS i.e.
Android OS.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0.35cm""><br></p>
<p align=""CENTER"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.35cm""></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0.35cm"">With the launch of Android operating
system, it silently killed iOS. It eliminates all the cons of iPhone
listed above &amp; some more which I haven’t &amp; came up with
more great features. Today Android leads with the biggest App Store &amp;
most widely used mobile OS. 
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0.35cm"">I would like to compare iOS with
Tally &amp; Android OS as ERPNext. Like some people are still firm on
using Tally over ERPNext(or any other ERP Product). They still don’t
wanna use latest technology.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0.35cm"">Just one more statement for iPhone
“R.I.P. - iPhone”</p>   ","","","General"
"","changing-gears","Changing Gears","rushabh","","<p>Probably 5-10% of whatever new code / features I have written in the
last year have been released. <em>That is pretty unimpessive</em>. Not only is it bad
productivity, but also does not help customers who have been
waiting for these featuers for a long time.</p>

<p>Last week we finally nailed the reason.</p>

<p><em>ERPNext is too big and critical for major rewrites</em></p>

<p>That is true. There are so many features that need to be tested and fixed
before we make any change. Old data has to be scrubbed, user customizations
need to be taken care of. At this point, ERPNext is being customized in crazy
number of ways and there is no way we can fix something without breaking
something else.</p>

<p><em>So what is the solution?</em></p>

<h4>Everyday Release</h4>

<p>From this week onwards, I have moved my role from the creator and architect
to customer support engineer. Now I make sure that whatever I code, gets
shipped the very same day or the next day. This will drastically reduce
my scope of changes, but it will make sure I am very productive.</p>

<p>Since I am usually at the beginning of feature development, (face in palms)
testing is not my strength. But now since I can potentially create havoc
in the product, I have to be a lot more mindful. For starts, I now sit
next to Umair, so I can overhear - oversee all the support issues first hand.</p>

<h4>Zero Tickets</h4>

<p>The first result is that on Monday we had 29 Open Tickets. On Wednesday,
before close, we were zero (yahoo!).</p>

<p>We have also created a new link in the footer, for those who may not have
noticed called ""Latest Updates"" that will tell you what has been changed.</p>

<p>So expect frequent changes. And let us know asap if something you like
is not there and we will try and get it done soon.</p>

<h4>Priorities</h4>

<p>Priorities are things that are outright bad in ERPNext - poor usability,
features not working as advertised, annoying stuff.</p>

<p>Next is ""onboarding"" - whatever is required to make implementation of ERPNext
a happy and delightful (ok passable) experience. Right now implementing
ERPNext is a test of your will and character. We hope
to make it a lot more civil. Our target is that any new user should
be able to implement without using a single swear word.</p>

<p>After that is new features - Languages, Cost of Goods sold and the works.
Thankfully Nabin and Anand will now take my postion as developers of new
features.</p>

<h4>The Punch</h4>

<p>Till today, ERPNext was nice (as in, the nice guy that finished last), but 
now we will bring in the punch, a.k.a. the killer focus, a.k.a. the attention to detail
that separates good products from bad. We know we had it, but we just
did not know how to make it happen operationally.</p>

<p>The new Everyday Release (TM) will hopefully do it for us!</p>

    @import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Happy+Monkey);
</style>
<div>Egypt was in the middle of a social revolution when we had a dialogue with Mr. Hisham Farid, IT Manager of City Glass. He assured us that business was not restricted and the situation there, was under control. For offices and factories business was regular.
    There were no shutdowns or holidays.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>Amidst this widespread unrest, looking at the company and its march gives us comfort that a company can continue doing business even in such turbulent times.&nbsp;</div>

</div>
<div><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;"">City Glass is a manufacturer and exporter of handmade and automated glass tableware in Egypt. It is a major player and valued supplier of glassware products. They export 80% of their production to Iraq, KSA Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Sudan, Libya, Morocco,
    Italy, Spain, Germany, USA &amp; Mexico. They also have their own network in Turkey, Italy, and USA.</span><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;"">&nbsp;</span>

</div>
<div><hr></div><div><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;"">This company started as a very small glass factory. They used manual techniques to produce glasses. Later, they adopted German technology and produced 5 tons per day. Within a few years they established two more factories. Their current production limit
    is 120 tons a day.&nbsp;</span>

    <br>
</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>This is a company that moved on from old technology and embraced modern production lines. When they migrated and expanded their operations, their information technology systems also needed an upgrade.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>

<h4>Challenges&nbsp;</h4>

<div>They were operating on an Egyptian software to maintain all their data. The three factories, their accounting transactions, different operational processes, and numerous employee records had become a herculean task to manage. They felt the need for a
    software that could integrate all their operations and data. Their IT manager, Mr. Hisham Farid, &nbsp;had good experience with Oracle so he decided to get an ERP system for the company. However, he knew that Oracle was not suited for a medium-sized company
    like City Glass. He needed something that would manage a medium-sized enterprise with an easy to use interface. After some research he came across ERPNext.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>

<h4>The Solution</h4>

    </div>
</div>
<div>Mr. Hisham Farid, went against the convention of implementing a proprietary and costly software and decided to embrace an open-source solution for his company. With ERPNext, he was able to do away with heavy installations and consultation charges. He
    is a happy man and pleased with his decision.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>We inquired whether he faced any resistance from the company employees to adopt ERPNext. Initially there was a lot of resistance to implementation from old Microsoft users. However, they migrated after they saw the simple and easy to run application.</div>

<div>Initially, the manufacturing department too was reluctant to adapt to a new software. Their Quality Team had a special quality check form that needed to be filled before production began. The form that ERPNext provided did not have all the specifications
    that City Glass needed. However, it was easy to customise ERPNext to add these missing fields. After operating ERPNext for some time, their teams realised that ERPNext is pretty easy to navigate and gave seamless integration with other functional departments.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>Today, City Glass has successfully migrated all their operations, along with their subsidiaries, to ERPNext. They are using normal ADSL lines to work with their factories and Head office, and confirm that they are very happy with the speed of operations.They
    insist that <b>ERPNext doesn't need any costly and complex hardware installation</b>. They are using a normal Dell server which costs one-third of other servers like Microsoft Dynamics or Oracle E-Business suit . Even their ex-SAP users say “<b>ERPNext system is
    better and easier</b>” to use. They are happy with ERPNext and so are we. They are our first donors.</div>","2013-10-28",1,"ERPNext Customer Stories"

A small effort to fix it.","Few weeks back, I had sent a mail via the system to all active and trial users about what they did <b>not</b> like about the system. Most of the new users found ERPNext <i>overwhelming</i>. They found the forms too confusing and that was a big discouragement for
them going forward. This needed fixing.

<div>Few of months ago, Apple released their newest upgrade to their popular phone operating system, iOS7 and they decided to go in for a pared down, minimalist view, with shocking colours. The upgrade came in for mixed reviews and most users were critical
    of the updates. My personal view was also of initial rejection. But slowly I came around, one day, I finally ""got"" it. The new user interface felt a lot lighter and had minimum cognitive overload.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>Now, many of you would not be wrong of accusing us of falling prey to the latest design fads, but this one just felt right. So I spent a week hacking the bootstrap CSS and some layout elements. I also cleaned up some of the main forms and here are the
    results.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<h3>The Old Form</h3>
<div>The old form had a bunch of problems. There was too much of ""non-core"" content on the page, too many toolbars, buttons, etc and the content often got buried - giving rise to the ""overwhelming"" feeling.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>

"","closing-the-documentation-loop","Closing The Documentation Loop","rushabh","Fixing our Achilles Heels: Documentation!","For developers, documentation is usually painful. The biggest reason, I suppose is the ""context"" switching that happens while shifting from coding to writing mode. And documentation has its own issues:
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li>It should be available on the web so that users can search.</li>
        <li>There has to be user + developer documentation.</li>
        <li>It should be easy to make.</li>
        <li>It should have screenshots!</li>
    </ol>
    <div>
        <br>
    </div>
     <h4>Take 1: Blogspot</h4>

    <div>The very first attempt to document was started by Umair in April 2010 at Blogspot: <a href=""http://erpnext.blogspot.in/"">http://erpnext.blogspot.in/</a>. At that time, we had just started with the erpnext name and we did not have enough documentation
        tools. So we started with whatever free tool we thought would work best for us - Blogspot. That site got more than 32,000 visits and still manages to get 15 page views a day!</div>
    <div>
        <br>
    </div>
     <h4>Take 2: The Manual</h4>

    <div>The blogspot site was good for quickly replying to support queries, but it did not contain enough explanation for users who wanted deeper understanding. So I decided that I should take a break from writing code and I started with the <a href=""https://erpnext.com/manual"">ERPNext Manual</a> sometime
        in early 2012. After one month of effort - the Manual was created. There was one major problem. I wrote this in Pages and there was no way to make this searchable on the web. Also being in Pages which is a Mac only software it was hard for anyone else
        to edit it. The manual did help us reduce our support load a bit more but still it was fast getting obsolete.</div>
    <div>
        <br>
    </div>
     <h4>Take 3: Website</h4>

    <div>Again we decided that Umair and Prakash would take the responsibility of making the manual and by this time, the website module was getting mature. So they started re-writing the manual in the website and managed to <a href=""http://prh.erpnext.com/erpnext-help"">create this version</a>. The problem
        was again that the approach was more instructions than explanations.</div>
    <div>
        <br>
    </div>
     <h4>Take 4: Documentation Tool</h4>

    <div>There was another big hole we had to fill. Developer Documentation. The only time we did developer documentation was way back in 2009-2010 and it was very much outdated. For the documentation, we used Sphinx, the Python standard documentation tool. But
        there was no way to document Javascript functions and almost 50% ERPNext is in Javascript.</div>
    <div>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>Since January 2013, we started getting a lot of developer interest and we did not have documentation ready to help them customize ERPNext. So we needed a tool to build that too. Finally it struck to me that there must be a better way to generate the
        documentation. So I started building a new tool. In the new tools, all documentation, user / developer will be built from the repository and it should be very easy to rebuild it.</div>
    <div>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>The new documentation tools handles different types of sources separately. (If you are on your local machine, you login as Administrator and go to ""#Form/Documentation Tool"" to start the front-end):</div>
    <div>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Static files (<a href=""https://github.com/webnotes/erpnext/tree/master/docs"">https://github.com/webnotes/erpnext/tree/master/docs</a>) are built from markdown. There is a custom header where you can define the title and the table of contents of that page.</li>
            <li>Javascript code is inspected inside the ERPNext application and using some basic parsing we will be identify the function names and arguments.</li>
            <li>Python objects are inspected on the server side and passed to the client and masked as javascript objects. The same tools are then used to build the documentation pages.</li>
        </ol>
        <div>This means that the code documentation must be built in the browser. That was okay, but still it took almost 30+ seconds to rebuild the entire docs. This was not acceptable for making minor edits to the static files. So I ended up moving part of the
            documentation generation to server using Jinja Templating.</div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>Finally the issue was of hosting and maintaining versions. We were keen to use GitHub Pages, fast becoming a standard for Open Source projects for hosting our documentation and we also wanted to use the erpnext.org domain. Since the documentation was
        built in the `public/docs` folder, Anand thought it was a good idea to make it a git repository that will point to the GitHub Pages repository.</div>
    <div>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>And that was it. Now updating documentation takes only a few steps:</div>
    <div>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Edit the doc files.</li>
            <li>Add images / screenshots if any in the public/docs/img folder.</li>
            <li>Build the static docs using `lib/wnf.py --docs`.</li>
            <li>Add, commit and push to <a href=""https://github.com/erpnext/erpnext.github.io"">https://github.com/erpnext/erpnext.github.io</a>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div>Yes thats it.</div><div><br></div><div>And heres the output: <a href=""http://erpnext.org"">http://erpnext.org</a></div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>Not only is it easy to push new documentation but we hope the community can also start participating!</div>

Both has it's pros and cons. It is more difficult when the organization is a startup with limited resources and the product is complex like ERP.</p>
<p>After a huge round of discussion in last month, we reached in a conclusion that we will do both. Yes, we are starting a new version of ERPNext from scratch. But at the same time, we will fix bugs, do continuous improvement and add small features in the existing version till the new version be ready.</p>
<p>Why new development from scratch?</p>
<ul>
<li>Design: Development from scratch will give freedom to change the core design if required.</li>
<li>Functional knowledge: Now we have better functional knowledge to make the design more robust.</li>
<li>Test-Driven Development: We will do test-driven development in the new version, so it will be more stable. It will give flexibility to add new features in the future without affecting existing features.</li>
<li>E-commerce integration: The new version will be fully e-commerce integrated. It means you can manage your e-commerce website portal from the ERP itself.</li>
<li>Well-organized and Readable Code-base: The code will be well organized, commented and object oriented, hence more readability. It will help open source community to understand the code and contribute easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>As new version will take a long time (approx. 6 months) to live, we will remain equally focused to improve the current version.</p>
<p>And yes don't worry about the data migration, we will take care of it.</p>
<p>We are confident that you will like the new version :)</p>

While our daughters existence in our life has become all-pervading, the car failed to keep pace and needed replacing.
    <br>
</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>The search for a new car had been initiated. There were so many cars in the market. There was Ponda-tt, Helios, Yoyota, Pakoda, Nonova etc. Every make represented something. While Ponda tt was an ""aspirational "" car, Nonova was rendered unaffordable
    (courtesy government tax on SUV's). There was a mind-boggling range to choose from. It was very easy to get carried away with all the options. Thankfully, my partner, as always, knew exactly what he wished for in his car. All the features that he wished
    were for his family's comfort. He needed leg space for his parents, little table for his daughter to draw, and a good music system for his wife. For himself, he chose only the ""buying experience"".</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>The car that gave the best buying experience got selected. Once the payment was done, the experience changed. We were no longer on their priority list. We were on the waitlist. The buying experience turned sour.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>While I was fuming over the apathy shown by the car dealer and forming nasty opinions, I witnessed another scenario. A troubled customer had called our office for support. Prakashji took the call. The customer was speaking native Marathi language, so
    Prakashji responded in that language. I do not know what the customer said, but I was awestruck by Prakashji's response. He said in Marathi, "" I understand what you are going through, just give me a minute, I will see how I can help you"". Although, these
    words sound ordinary to read, they were different when he uttered them. He really felt the pain of the customer. He meant every word that he said. From his face I could gather that he looked very sad that the customer was facing problem. It was amazing
    to see how polite and caring he was to the customer. For a moment, I thought probably he is just acting, but when I looked at him, I was surprised to see that the emotion was real.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>In one realm, I had experienced a complete apathy towards a customer after the payment was done. In other, I saw how considerately a customer was dealt with, who by all means, would have been our open-source customer availing free services. &nbsp;Car
    manufacturers conduct so many workshops for their management to learn the importance of customers, yet their executives show a very sweet persona before payment, and a lackluster approach after payment. While the business gurus and the management mentors
    have been relentlessly drilling the significance of creating customer experiences, the sales world operates only on the parameters of “target-met” and “target-achieved”.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>At ERPNext, there are no targets. There are no sales-people. There is support and there is product development. I have a sales and marketing background, so it was very difficult for me to understand how a company who doesn't have a sales department can
    survive. It just defies my business logic. However, now that I have worked here, I understand how it works. The concept of good product and efficient support is not a management fad . ""Word of mouth"" and referrals from clients, forms our major business
    strategy. We just do good work. The business follows. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>","2013-09-23",1,"Management"

I even learnt Martial Arts to have the valor to save some knight in trouble! I took all these efforts to avoid typecasting myself to this idiom.

I was assigned to Umair for product understanding. However, Umair was so busy saving the outer world, that by the time he came for my help I was already under water. The next knight was Akhilesh. Thankfully, Akhilesh believed that teaching a person to swim, is more important than giving him a boat. With his efforts I learnt to stay afloat. To give Akhilesh a break and let him do his own swimming peacefully, I began to ask help from Nabin, Anand and Prakash. Anand’s rescue is so fast, that before you catch your breath you are out of the troubled water. The rescue is so lightning fast that there is no way you can figure out what really went wrong in the first place. So I began to ask Nabin’s help more often. He is one knight who is in demand all the time. The outer world, the inner world, customers, colleagues, coders, non-coders, just about everyone wishes that Nabin should come to their rescue. He is the ultimate life-guard who is the hero of &nbsp;Baywatch. Everybody feels safe when he comes for rescue. He seems to know every underpinnings of the sea. He knows when the tide strikes and when it is time for storms. Somehow, Nabin &nbsp;manages to bring everybody ashore without losing a single life.

When at work their minds are like still waters.

But I also couldn't login to our backup server. Further, I was unable to access Hetzner's website (our server host). So, the issue might be with Hetzner's network. To confirm this, I used my phone's internet connection to access erpnext.com and hetzner.de - it worked! So the problem was not with Hetzner after all, but with my Internet Service Provider (ISP) - MTNL. Nothing to worry, customer's weren't affected. Or so I thought.</p><h4>Support Ticket</h4><p>I logged into our ERPNext account and found that three of our customers were unable to access their accounts. They were from Mumbai, Delhi and Sri Lanka.

""whois"", a command that reveals the ownership of an ip address, revealed that it belonged to Bharti Airtel Limited. So a router, belonging to Airtel, was unable to send the packet further along its path.</p><h4>What Now?</h4><p>I am not a customer of Airtel. So I dialed MTNL's customer support. After exchanging a few phone calls and emails, they helped me escalate the issue to the person responsible for their network. However, before I can send him the traceroute, the issue was resolved. Airtel had re-routed their traffic via a router with ip address 125.62.187.193.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>ERPNext was inaccessible to some users in the Indian Sub-continent for about two hours, owing to a router malfunction belonging to an ISP in India. I learnt that I could help by registering a complaint to the right people. Also, MTNL has a very co-operative staff. I appreciate them for their effort and time.</p>","2013-04-03",1,"Technology"
"","demo-day---june","Demo Day - June 2012","rushabh","This month onwards we are starting a new management system as we posted on the earlier blog where essentially apart from solving customer is","<p>This month onwards we are starting a <a href=""http://erpnext.com/open-source-work-culture.html"">new management system</a> as we posted on the earlier blog where essentially apart from solving customer issues everyone is free to work on any other thing they think is useful for the organization and product and we would all sync and comment on each other's work on the last Thursday of the month, that we will call Demo Day. There will also be a reward for the best work.</p>
<p>So we had our first Demo Day yesterday and it was great. Here are some of the take-aways.</p>
<h2>What Worked</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Everyone is usually so much into their own work that they rarely know, or appreciate what others are doing in the organization. This was a great opportunity to learn about other people's work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rewind the last sentence. Everyone is so much into their own ""day-to-day"" work that they even forget what work <em>they</em> themselves have done in the month. This is a great way to review one's own work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being in a business where most communication is over email or phone, giving presentations is a skill that is usually forgotten. Demo Day made sure everyone brushed up their presentations skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demo Day gave an opportunty step back from their work and take bird eye's view of where we are as company and where we are going. You may think ERPNext is a startup, but even startups have a lot of different things happening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This also gave an opportunity for everyone else to ask me a few tough questions - like how am I going to make sure we reach our sales target (I confess I was not prepared for such scrutiny).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also shared stuff like what are our website analytics, how many visitors, how many downloads, how many signups, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone was energized by the work done by everyone else and seeing their team mates present, gave everyone the motivation to present better next time!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>What did not work</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The pizzas were awful (we are talking about you, Smokin' Joes). Next time there will be better pizzas or something else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No projector: Since we never do any presentations, we don't have a projector in the office. We will correct that too. We will also see nice TED videos over lunch :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The point system: Since we are a small team, I personally felt that the point system was not a good way because it involved judgement of work everyone may not be comfortable or qualified to do. So we will scrap the point system.</p>
</li>
</ol>

"","design-for-change","Design For Change","rushabh","","<p>Complex software projects like ERPNext have a long development cycle. You are passionate about technology and someone has to nudge you to start the project. Then you start understanding the domain a bit. The first people who you talk to will sow seeds that will go very deep and will form the genesis of the project. You start giving form to your ideas.</p>

<p>Then you start finding ""how"" to execute the ideas. You learn about software development, you learn about databases, you learn about web servers and web frameworks. Somewhere down the line, you don't like the frameworks out there so you start to write your own. After a while a prototype is emerges. You are forced to implement it immediately because the legacy software has crashed and the original developer has left the country. You work on your prototype, fixing bugs under pressure and veiled threats from users.</p>

<p>Then you think its time to start a company, but you don't know about business, so you rope in a partner. You do sales, pitches, projects, code, make website, document, recruit. You don't really understand the industry and the market so you struggle. Customers don't close deals, those who have don't pay up. You keep doing pitches and waste time. You keep changing your business strategy. You realize your first ideas were very bad. Losses start piling up. Things start falling apart. Your team loses faith in you. Servers crash. Tears flow. You are generally in a mess.</p>

<p>You hang on either by default or fate, things start improving a bit. You start understanding things better. The code improves. The market strategy gets clearer. The product progresses and matures. The users grow a bit. You have much deeper domain knowledge. But the product still sucks. The technology and design world moves even faster. You still have a lot of catching up to do.</p>

<p>What is constant in all this is change. Users change, strategies change, technologies change, designs change, domains change, expectations change. What is clear is that you start someplace and you quickly keep moving or are forced to move. The real challenge is to be ready to constantly change and renew.</p>

<p>In my days of studying Industrial Engineering (no, I am not formally trained in software), I learnt of this concept of ""Design for Manufacturing"". What it meant that a design should be easy to manufacture. All parts must be of material and sizes must be standard, body shapes must be easy to cast / die, the parts must be easy to assemble etc. This kind of thinking does wonders for profitability and quality. It does not take a lot of brains to understand why.</p>

<p>The analogy for this in software engineering is ""Design-for-Change"". A software is more like a narrative than a product. Your features are characters and your usability is the pace of the plot. If the narrative is short (blog post), you can rewrite it easily. When you start you probably have a lot of ideas in your mind about what you have to write. But a software product is like a really long narrative and you can rewrite it only part by part.</p>

<p>Principles of Design-for-Change in software are also very similar to Design-for-Manufacturing:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>""DRY"" or don't-repeat-yourself:</strong> This is really hard because many times patterns start forming much earlier than you realize. Say if you want to change the way a button behaves and there are many other such buttons that you will have to change individually, then tough luck. You are stuck with your current design.</li>
<li><strong>Use standard libraries:</strong> Libraries keep updating themselves and also have communities to support them. With the introduction of Twitter Bootstrap, JQuery + Bootstrap is a killer combo for web development.</li>
<li><strong>Write clear code with consistent naming:</strong> It should be intuitive to anticipate where this code might be specially if you have large number of code files.</li>
<li><strong>Learn from your mistakes:</strong> Take time out to think about why something went wrong and what can you do to avoid it. Many times we just keep moving from issue to issue without taking a step back to realize why things happen.</li>
<li><strong>Automated testing:</strong> This would have been great for us but we did not start out test-driven and right now we have so much ""wiring"" that testing the basic components does not make much sense as the faults are mostly in the wiring.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end there is nothing to beat experience. You may get lucky if your product comes out good for the first time. Change is also a test because you are constantly questioning your own thinking. People who look up to you are also confused, but when you know that what you have is not the best, change is the only option. And this only thing that can make things a bit easier is if your product is designed to be in a constant state of change.</p>

"","diferent-route","Different Route","deleted","Journey on an un-expected path.","<p>I know that you have lots of questions in your mind. First one, who am I? I am Saurabh Palande, I have completed Bachelors of Engineering in Computers and now I am working with Web Notes as Software Developer. And I have completed my OCA and OCPJP certifications.</p>
<p>So why is this post titled Different Route? Its not that I caught a wrong train or something.</p>
<p>Since I have completed OCPJP (Oracle Certified Professional Java Programmer) certification, I was looking for a Java job. Why Java? I had learnt four languages during my Engineering those were C, C++, VB and Java. From these, I decided to go with Java because with Java I can work on a variety of problems in core development, web development, mobile development etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since decided Java as career, so after completing BE I started searching for jobs in Java. There were some beautiful experiences in this job hunting mission which I wish to discuss with you all, but I am not including all these things in this blog so don&rsquo;t worry, we will discuss this on some other day. So in phase of job hutting after six months of struggle I did not get a single job. Then I started thinking that let me migrate to Bangalore because 7 out of 10 job postings were from Bangalore.</p>
<p>While thinking on this plan, one day my friend told me that there is an opening for Java/.Net developer in a Vidyavihar Company named as Web Notes. I went for that interview and after a discussion the interviewer told me that you are short listed and we will call you later for next round. After this I had given up my hopes. In my past experience with companies, I don't know why, they never tell you directly that you are rejected. They always say we will call you later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After two days they called me and gave me the good news. Ohh wait, not good news but one of the best news of my life that I have been hired as a Software Developer to work on, wait, &lsquo;Python&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s why I was saying DIFFERENT ROUTE. I was dreaming about Java and planning to migrate to Bangalore and now I am working as Python developer and in Mumbai only. It&rsquo;s a great feeling.</p>","2013-03-08",0,"Personal"
"","does-a-startup-need-an-erp","Does A Startup need an ERP","mehul","ERPNext Customer Mehta Herbs looks at their experience trying to use an ERP as a startup.","<h4>Introduction</h4>
<br>
<p>We are a startup based in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. We are engaged in the
manufacture of aloe vera cosmetics. Though we were incorporated in 2004 a large part of the time was spent in product development, setting up of the manufactuirng unit and getting the licence for
the same. During this period we used to carry out the administration of the Company using Tally
and primitive systems of administration if one could call it that. Initial trial marketing was started
sometime in 2008 and it continued till early 2011 to help us gain an insight into the market and
make necessary adjustments to the product for market acceptability. It was during this time we
became aware, that if we had to go in for full fledged marketing, we cannot continue with our old
ways of administration.</p>
<br>
<h4>Early Days</h4>
<p>Most of the transaction points like selling, POS, payments, receipts and deliveries we
done manually. For every transaction the respective support document was prepared manually. This
was done at various locations and was sent physically to the HO. At the HO we used to manually
enter each transaction into Tally and then finally prepare the accounts. This is what I meant by being
primitive in today's age and time. Our production was managed in an even more inefficient manner
but we got away with it as the products were only being test marketed.</p>
<br>
<h4>The Way Forward</h4>
<p>It was during this time we thought that there should be a better way of
functioning. Something that is more faster, efficient and meaningful. Someone suggested that we
should invest in an erp and that should solve all our problems. The search began to find a suitable
erp system. While reviewing some of them a common thought that used to come up was do we need
all the complex functionality and was is it worth investing such a lot as most of the erp systems
were costing a minimum of Rs. 2 lacs (US$ 4000) upwards just for the software, hardware being extra. Besides, some of them just could not handle the basic transaction requirement which we needed like
additional cost of purchase. There was a lot of internal debating and finally we concluded that if we
came across an erp that is functional and affordable we should give it a shot.</p>
<br>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>That was when we came across ERPNext. It was a google search which popped up the
website and the first look was impressive. The cost was really less for one year plus it covered
hosting, support and updates released during the year. This was too good to be true. We did not have
to invest in new hardware, servers, static ip etc. and if that was not enough we also got an option to
have our website from within the erp. This was far more than what we had bargained for and to be
really frank I thought there would be some hidden costs which would suddenly surface once we
signed up. Nevertheless after confirming the details and some clarifications regarding taxes,
additional costs of purchase etc. we signed up for the 30 day trail. Since I had tried out various erp's
I was familiar with how an erp functions and hence could go about the initial setup very easily.
However, I still feel ERPNext is by far one of the easiest to implement and very user friendly. This
fact was vindicated when my staff, for whom it was the first erp, were comfortable using it within a
week of setting it up.</p>
<br>
<h4>Journey so far</h4>
<p>We went live in the middle of the financial year and are now using the erp for all
our administration. All transactions related to accounts, purchases, sales and stock are being done
with ERPNext. We are working on the website and plan to go live with it once we begin launching
our products. The ERPNext team plans to have a web shop feature which we look forward to using
for marketing our products. We plan to use the blog to update our customers about us and our
products. We are also looking at using the manufactuing module comprehensively to help with our
producttion. I believe this is going to be an area where the full benefits of using the erp would
become apparent. These are features we were not looking for initially, but since they are part of the
system, we think they would be beneficial to use. I think in that sense ERPNext adds a lot of value.
And there were no hidden extras once we signed up.</p>
<br>
<h4>In Conclusion</h4>
<p>Should a startup invest in an erp? The short answer is yes. If the business that one
plans to start has a feasible business plan and as the promoter one has the passion to see through the
business plan one should go ahead with investing in ERPNext. I really believe if we had something
like ERPNext at the beginning stages of our startup we could have utilised a lot of the management
time productively for getting the startup off the ground. We can see the difference the erp is making
within six months of use which I think is remarkable.</p>
<br>
<p>I would also like to appreciate the team at ERPNext for coming up with a product like this
which benefits SME's in many tangiable ways. SME's which form the backbone of most economies
can really benefit with ERPNext as it is simple, comprehensive, affordable and the team provides
very good support. It will help small companies to think bolder, bigger and compete in the
marketplace. As the days go by, we look forward to using it more comprehensively in improving
business productivity and using it to better manage the resources of our Company.</p>","2013-04-12",1,"ERPNext Customer Stories"

<h3>Some background:</h3>

<p>Now there are many customers using ERPNext for quite sometime (including 
ourselves, in the 5th year!), hence we have collected a lot of data. But so 
far it was hard to get any reports, other than standard ones out of ERPNext.</p>

<p>There were 2 major issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Reports are expensive: They take a lot of processing and since we
host many customers on one server, we were vary of have too any queries
clogging our servers.</p></li>
<li><p>Browser has its limitations: Until recently, it was not possible to show
a lot of data on the browser. The performance would degrade rapidly after a
few hundred rows of data.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>So what happened?</h3>

<p>Well, we killed both the birds with the same arrow :). What we did is
probably unique in the world of ERP systems. So here is the 
magic recipe we tried: Instead of letting the server
do all the heavy processing, we decided that we will dump all the required
data in the client (based on permissions ofcourse!) and let the browser
compute all the analysis.</p>

<p>Also thanks to fantastic open source projects
like <a href=""https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid"">Slick Grid</a> and
<a href=""http://www.flotcharts.org/"">Flot</a>, it is now possible to show huge amount
of data in the browser without making it sweat too much.</p>

<p><em>And it worked! And how!</em></p>

<h3>Try it out right now!</h3>

<p>The results of our experiment are ready for you to see. Here is a list of
reports we have released:</p>

"","erpnext-customer-story-getting-started-with-an-erp","ERPNext Customer Story: Getting started with an ERP","mehul","How ERPNext is helping our pharma startup get off the ground.","<p>This last month has been quite productive for us not just in terms of using the ERP but also for us as we are getting ready to start production of our cosmetic products.&nbsp;</p><p>This was when we decided to look seriously at the website module and to be honest I was a little skeptical about having the website from the ERP. I thought maybe it may not serve our purpose entirely. As we explored the module I was pleasantly surprised at the functionality that it presents and how a startup like us can benefit from the same. Yes we have had to make some changes to the web layout and stuff but then I can see that its in the right direction as you pointed out that it needs to be optimised for various devices. Looking at various websites I can see that many are opting for a single column layout. I appreciate the fact that you explained the reasoning for the same and did not just try to justify the way the ERP works.</p><p>Our staff at the office are pretty ordinary people who work hard to make sure the administration of a company's affairs are carried out smoothly. They are not computer literate in the sense that they cannot manage everything on a computer. They have no training on the various office softwares but have learnt on the job and know the basics of what needs to be done. When we decided to shift from tally to erpnext it was huge task for them mentally as they were in a comfort zone with tally. They could manage with tally in their own way without getting intimidated. Initially we had like &nbsp;a handholding phase for about a week when we went live with erpnext. I showed them the various things they needed to know and then slowly asked them to start using the product. The data forms look more complex than tally but thats for obvious reasons. Once they came to terms with the fact that we are going ahead with the implementation they gave a serious shot to understand an ERP. The fact that within a week they were as comfortable with ERPNext as they were with tally speaks a lot about the ease of use of ERPNext.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of ERPs basically do the same thing. ERPNext is pretty much the same. It helps in managing the resources of a company. The difference between ERPNext and others I feel is the ease with which you can get things done. Though a lot of products pitch this functionality very few actually deliver on the same. The product might have the capability to do a particular function but if its not easy to use its as good as not having the functionality. I have really appreciated the product when we decided to do the website because so many things can be done with a few clicks and you have a good professional looking website. The same applies to the other modules as well.</p><p>Being Open Source, free and easy to use can be used very well for marketing your product. A lot of people, me included, feel really harassed when we deal with companies pitching their softwares. Apart of the initial costs there is always a catch somewhere and then you end up spending something every year without actually getting any benefit from the same. I really like the fact that you guys are giving the product free of cost and are charging only for the services. It gives me a lot of peace as I don't have to bother about the installation, hardware etc.. Going ahead we are thinking of using ERPNext for one of our other companies as well. I cannot give you a time frame but we are surely giving it a serious thought. Since it is an older company we need to deal with some legacy issues. Once we are through with them I guess we can move ahead quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>As with all good things the challenge is in remaining true to your core self. Sometimes in this mad rush of life we tend to forget what actually made the product a success. I am saying this with our experience with cosmetics. We added products which our sales partners demanded without thinking too much into it and finally ended up being confused with what and who we were. We actually have had to stop production, scrap product lines and also change the brand name. We are again starting from where we had started earlier only that we will now take a slightly different path. I see that you guys are improving the product by leaps and bounds after introducing the regular updates model. So far it has been in line with what the product stands for. I just hope that you don't dilute your core product values as you go about improving the product and adding functionality. It would be one hell of a blow if that happens. I would like to end on this note and hope that its has given some food for thought without sounding preachy. Keep up the good work as your effort is definitely helping small companies in becoming organised in what is increasingly a chaotic world.</p>","2013-03-15",1,"ERPNext Customer Stories"

Recently, we received an inquiry from a ho","<p>ERPNext is designed for business units dealing in manufacturing and selling of goods and services. Recently, we received an inquiry from a <strong>housing society</strong>. This blog is about how we mapped the requirement of housing society with ERPNext.</p>
<p>The housing societies have some basic requirement like maintaining database of tenants, raising monthly maintenance bills, managing expenses, tracking vendors and their quotations. Not just that, the residential towers are not a mere residential apartments (specially in Bombay), but the few mighty tenents are smart enough to pull out revenue model from it. Income from mobile phone towers being recent development, hoarding and rental from open spaces are famous ways to swing in money.</p>
<p><img style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" src=""files/Selection_387.1.png"" alt=""mobile"" title=""tower"" height=""288"" width=""558"" /></p>
<p>The common pratice between company and housing society are filling tax returns, authorizing bills and preparating annual statements. This calls for an application which can track the taxation on every income and expense transactions, generate reports for review of tenants, track maintenance activities and lot more.</p>
<p>Since ERPNext is an application to fullfill the requirement of business house, be ready for work-arounds when implementing it in housing society.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tenant's Database:<br />You can add all the tenants as a Customers. This will allow society to bill customer via Sales Invoice for monthly maintenance charges. Also, you will be able to track out-standing from each tenant.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Vendors:<br />Vendors can be tracked as Suppliers. The bills made for purchases will update the expense account of society. Again, separate ledger for each vendor allows you tracking payable.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Booking Other Incomes:<br />You can create Sales Invoice for updating income received from other income sources like mobile phone towers, hoardings and renting open space.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Tax Returns:<br />As per the staturoy requirement, even housing society need to maintain there books of accounting and file the tax return. ERPNext allows you to maintain multiple tax ledgers and run a general ledger report to analyze the entries made in it. You can export the same data in spreadsheet and edit it to get the format demanded by government authorities.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Maintenance Scheduling:<br />ERPNext has a form which allows you to pre-schedule the maintenence activities. You can allocate the same to concern person for whom event will be added in his/her calender as a reminder.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Complaints:<br />Support Ticket is the form where all tenants can log a ticket via email to report breakdown. The unique id will be generated for each Support Ticket for ease in followup. The ticket can be allocated to concern which will add a item on his/her to-do list. The Support module in ERPNext can serve the requirement of Facility Management to large extend.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Projects Budgeting:<br />Big maintenance activities like building renovation etc. can be added as Project in ERPNext. Also, you can create a Cost Center for project to define budget.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Make public announcements using Calender and Messages.</li>
</ol>
<p>More importantly, a web-based application for housing society can bring in lots of tranparency among tenants. You can create a login id for a member of each house and let them access bills raised to them, add and check status of complaints logged.</p>
<p>Since activities in housing society is managed by its tenants which is almost like a part time job for them, an ERP applicatication can automate lots of repetative task and make their <em>life easy.</em></p>","2013-02-07",1,"ERPNext Features"

"","erpnext-introduction-to-tally-users","ERPNext Introduction To Tally Users","umair","ERPNext Introduction for Tally users.","<div>Let me start my blog by thanking Tally Inc. for introducing business software to Indians. We moved from paper sheets and spreadsheets to an application which could generate a financial statement and outstanding balances reports at one click.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong><br>Then why ERPNext?</strong></div>

<li>Your user need not be accounting experts, which is not the case with Tally.</li>
<li>Accessibility via the internet .</li>
<li>Easy to setup and implement.</li>
<li>Unlimited feature upgrades.</li>
<li>Unlimited users at a very affordable price and lot more..</li>
</ol>
<div>Users switching from Tally to ERPNext find ERPNext's interface very different and they may need guidance in the following areas, so that they can get used to the product.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong style=""font-size: 1em;""><br>1. Creating Ledgers:</strong></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Ledger is called an Account in ERPNext. ERPNext uses a tool called Chart of Accounts, which has a tree structure and allows you to define groups and ledgers. With creation of company, system creates four core groups, few sub-groups and ledgers under them. The four core groups are:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Application of Funds (Assets)</li>
<li>Source of Funds (Liabilities)</li>
<li>Income</li>
<li>Expenses<br><br><img src=""files/Selection_376.png"" alt=""coa"" height=""228"" width=""464""></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4><br><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong>2. Updating Opening Balances in Ledger:</strong></h4>
<div>ERPNext follow the double entry accounting system. Hence, when updating opening balance for one accounting ledger (let's say Cash - credit account), you need select another ledger to balance it (any debit account). You can&nbsp;<span style=""font-size: 11.5px;"">also</span><span style=""font-size: 11.5px;"">&nbsp;update the opening balance in ledgers via an import utility.<br><br></span></div>
<h4><strong>3. Making Invoices:</strong></h4>
<div>Since ERPNext follows the accrual system, it assumes that payment will be received / made on a future date. In case of Sales Invoice, it will Debit Customer's ledger to update receivable against Customers. Similarly, Supplier's ledger as will be Credit to update the payable towards Supplier.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let's consider a scenario where you are making Sales Invoice for Customer. The customer purchases good worth $100. 10% is the tax applicable on it. Following will be the General Ledger Entries made when Sales Invoice is submitted.<br><br></div>
<p><img style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" src=""files/Selection_374.png"" alt=""Sales Invoice"" height=""101"" width=""289""></p>
<div>For Purchase Invoice, suppose you are purchasing goods worth $500. 15% is tax applicable. Also, $50 is the transportation charges borne by you.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 11.5px;"">Following will be the General Ledger Entries made when submitting Purchase Invoice.<br><br></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><img style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" src=""files/Selection_375.png"" alt=""purchase invoice"" height=""123"" width=""293""></div>
<h4><br><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong>4. Making Payment Entries:</strong></h4>
<div>Payment entries are made using a form called Journal Voucher. You will also find a button to make Payment Entry in the Outstanding Sales and Purchase Invoices, which will fill up the Journal Voucher form.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Journal Voucher can be used for&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;purposes like booking expenses, making adjustment and opening balance entries, contra vouchers, debit and credit notes.<br><br></div>

"","erpnext-open-day--","ERPNext Open Day July 2012","rushabh","","<p>Take Two: To quickly recap, two months ago we
decided to <a href=""open-source-work-culture.html"">welcome anarchy</a> in our organization by stopping centralized
work assignment. The way we co-ordinate is by syncing at the end of the
month on ""Open Day"" (previously we called it Demo Day).</p>

<h3>Its Hard to be Your own Boss</h3>

<p><br>
People who are used to a centralized
way of working (not thinking about the ""why""), when left to their
own means, will find crutches to go back to the old system they are
familiar with. Remindes me of a practice used on elephants in India.</p>

<p><em>When the elephants are young, they are tied with metal chains to a tree
so that they do not escape. The young elephant tries hard, but eventually
gives up trying to break it. After sometime, the chain is replaced by
a simple rope or a thread that the elephant can break easily. But the
elephant does not try. The chain is now only in the mind.</em></p>

<p>Something similar happened, the focus was totally on immediate issues
like support issues and minor requests. I know they are very important 
and should be solved, but there has to be a balance between short and long
term projects for the company to be successful.</p>

<p>A month is a real short time to judge and I am sure I am wrong.
The problem has now shifted to how does everyone in the company:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be fully aligned with the company's long term goals. (Does having a
fixed monthly income have to do with the alignment to short term?).</li>
<li>Become self-aware of one's own strengths and opportunities.</li>
<li>Have the ability to take a bird's eye view of all activities
in the company.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the next challenge. Some of the questions are hard. Like self
awareness, that usually comes when life surprises you and things don't 
go the way you expect, or when you read a lot. Some of the others like 
personal ambition and not accepting status-quo are even harder and depend 
on ""inner"" motivations and experiences.</p>

<p>The great thing is that when we first started this exercise, we never
thought we would be facing these type of problems. These seem to be very 
fundamental issues and all great companies would have to address them, 
I assume. A way to address them would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Better communication of the company's vision to everyone in the team, 
without sounding pedantic.</li>
<li>Understand everyone's deep rooted ambitions.</li>
<li>Shake up the apathy that is a part of the Indian culture. Maybe force
everyone to do something totally different from what they do.</li>
</ol>

<p>Would love to hear your suggestions!</p>

My business is running fine, I am making money, my customers are happy, my accountant is happy and I have already enough trouble with all the software I am using. So why use an ERP? Ok maybe I need one. All the time I am following up on my clients if I need to close a deal, or they are after me to deliver. I never have data when I need it. I don’t have control over my stock and I think all my employees are not working hard and they don’t appreciate what I am doing for them. I need an ERP to get my act together. Then I could go on the long promised vacation to the beach.<br><br>So a friend tells me that there is this very affordable online ERP that I could just sign up for and its got a 30 day trial. Its called ERPNext. So I go their website and it looks kind of a good tool. There is just too much stuff to read on their site, and it takes me ages to find the sign-up button. Why don’t they make it easier for people to sign up?? So I fill up the sign-up form and it goes through. It seems that they will manually approve the request. Ok I will wait for it. Since I am already on their site, I go through their blog. Its basically a brain dump of their employees. It seems like they like to blow their own trumpet a lot. Let me see if the software is half as good as they claim.<br><br>Its Monday morning and I get a mail from ERPNext that my account is setup. Nice, I will look into this later in the night, right now I have a lot of calls to make and my coffee isn’t ready either. Ha, no one cares about my coffee.<br><br>Its night and I am burning the midnight oil. Let me checkup this ERP. So I go the url they gave me and login. Its taking ages to load the page. How do they expect me to use this every day? Ok so I am in and there is a dumb form I have to fill. Wait, haven’t I filled this already? I fill it again and submit it. After a few seconds, it gives a message “Setup Done”. Thats it?? Don’t I have to setup my contacts or something?<br><br>I look at the application and I see a bunch of icons like my Android phone. This looks neat. Finally someone understands what it takes. But how do I get started? Do they expect me to figure it out myself? I just click on the accounting icon and I see large menu with around 30 items like Sales Invoice and Journal Voucher. What a mess. They should send me a manual or something.<br><br>Let me rack my brains, there must be a way to set this damn thing up. Let me setup the Item master. Now where could that be, there is no icon for “Masters”. So let me click on the icons one by one. Finally I find the Item master. They should give me a prize for finding it. When I click on it, I get a page with a button saying “Make your first Item”. Fair enough. So I click on it and I now have to fill a form that has like.... woah... 1500 data fields. Ok, I am exaggerating a bit but its too much for me and I am already sleepy. So I shut it down and go to bed.<br><br>I forget about it in the next few day, but then something bad happens. One of my customer is very angry that we delivered the wrong items to him. It happened to be a gift for his wife, so you can understand the gravity of the situation. The customer fires me, I fire my staff. There has to be a better way to manage this. So I write to the ERPNext guys. “Please help me people, I need your ERP to work”<br><br>I get back an email from Mr Umair saying that he will be happy (really?) to setup a small demo session for me to get started. So I say, lets do it and we setup a time.<br><br>I have already downloaded Team iewer and am ready for the session. Umair tells me that Teamviewer 8 will not work and I need to download version 7. What a pain. It takes me another 15 mins to setup and finally we are in and the demo beings. So we are back to the icons page and I can already recognize the modules. Umair walks me through the system and it looks easy. Why don’t they have a video for this? It could save me so much hassle. In the middle, Umair has to answer a few queries so I wait. Finally I get a sense of of this thing works and now I have to set it up. I thank Umair for his time and promise him I will give it one more shot.<br><br>The next few days pass by and its only late in the night I get time to try again. So after the slow sing-in, I start exploring. The screens seem so clunky and its so hard to figure out what is what. They should just have given some sample Items so that common people like me could figure what is happening. Finally after an hour of trial and error I am able to create one Item, Customer, Supplier and a Sales Order. Yay! Now what? The manual says I should get a button called “Make Invoice” or “Make Delivery Note”. This is crazy. Finally it dawns on me that I have to first “Submit” the order. Why so much complication?? Ok I submit it and make an Invoice. Great, now let me book a payment.<br><br>A new screen pops up and I get a form what is called a Journal Voucher. What the freak is that? Am I in 1980? Most softwares will automatically merge my bank account and here I am, trying to figure out what is debit and what is credit!&nbsp; I close my laptop and crash on my bed hope I would not get nightmares about debit and credit.<br><br>A couple of days later I get a mail from ERPNext saying that my trial is getting over. Thank God!! It surely felt like I was on trial! After spending so much time, I had barely managed to scratch the surface. How would I ever go about entering my 1500 Items, 400 Customers and all the pending data? How would I setup my opening balances and when will I get time to figure out the debit - credit nonsense??&nbsp; <br><br>I swear I am never going to setup an ERP again.... I guess until my customer shouts at me.<br></p><p><em>As you may have guessed, this is a parody.

"","free-or-open-source-software","Free or Open Source Software?","rushabh","Thoughts on Free Software and reflections from attending a talk by Richard Stallman, the father of Free Software","<h4>Richard Stallman</h4>Last week, we attended a talk by&nbsp;<a href=""http://stallman.org"" target=""_blank"">Richard Stallman</a>, the father of Free Software. He is legendary in tech circles for founding the GNU Project (GNU is Not&nbsp;Unix) and writing a lot of tools that
are a part of the Linux Operating System, which according to him, must be called GNU/Linux. Stallman is also known to have radical political views on software and has a set of terminology that he insists must be used by everyone talking about his work. His primary
disagreement is with the term Open Source, which he calls as pushovers. By pushovers, he means that the term Open Source software is tainted by the need for sustainability using commercial means. Often this is unfairly done either by only distributing parts of the software as free or by
keeping some features as paid.
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>
    <img src=""files/stallman.jpg"" style=""max-width: 300px"">
    <br>
</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>For Stallman, all software must be free and must be used in ways that all derivate works also have the same freedom. The thought is both noble and also a protection that companies do not pick up work from the community and bundle it as their own tools.
    The&nbsp;<a href=""http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html"" target=""_blank"">GNU General Public License</a>, also called as the&nbsp;""copyleft"" license, protects these rights. ERPNext too is licensed under this License, even though we position ERPNext as Open Source.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>Personally I am more pragmatic about the usage of the terminology. We use Open Source because our users understand this term more than Free. Also Free ERP has different connotations. Free stuff is eyed suspiciously as most people believe that there is
    a cost to everything. This is tragic because a lot of good free and open source software exists, and it is sad to see that because of such political issues, groups cannot get together to promote it. (I will use these terms interchangeably in this post.)</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>Stallman also talked a lot about surveillance and how governments are using devices to illegally and surreptitiously capture information of our likes, relations and movements. Even though we all need to be cautious against too much intrusion of privacy,
    these devices also bring a lot of convenience and freedom to us.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<h4>Advocacy</h4>
<div>One of the primary roles that Stallman and his Free Software Foundation (FSF) plays is that of advocating Free Software in education institutes and governments. Teaching Free Software to students is of vital importance because if they start getting familiar
    with free software, they will grow up to use it. Companies like Microsoft send sales people to promote their software to schools because they want to get young students to use their tools and grow familiar with them. In the same way, promoters of free
    software must also send volunteers to schools to promote free software.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>
    <img src=""files/advocacy.jpg"">
    <br>
</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>The second is governments. Governments by definition are owned by the commons. People pool in their taxes so that the government can work efficiently and the best bang for the buck is delivered when companies providing solutions are forced to use free
    software and publish their solutions as open source.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>India is lacking on both these counts. It is very sad to see that the few people who are promoting free software are also tired and depressed. Clearly new energy is required on these fronts. We at Web Notes feel very strongly about this and
    we hope to make some contribution here. Unfortunately we are also stuck with a couple of constraints. One, is of course that we first need to get our revenues in place and second, is that we don't know where to start. Maybe a fresh beginning is required.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<h4>What Can We Do?</h4>
<div>Our first goal, like I said earlier is that we need to ensure that we have surplus funds to invest in this area. ERPNext is surely growing very well and revenue is also increasing year on year; however, it is still not enough. If we divert our attention and focus on too many things, then we may lose the advantage that ERPNext has built up. Also, there is a lot to be done.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>If we had the resources, we would setup a voluntary effort for schools and governments where we could go and give them short presentations and also give free support for using Linux Desktops, Office tools, Mail Servers, Web Servers etc. The challenge would be in making the initial
    contact, then setting up a time, then doing the presentation and then offering support. This would be ideally done under the umbrella of Free Software Foundation of India. If they are very religious/suspicious about us, who have to earn our bread and don't live off grants, or there are too many ego-mountains
    to be climbed, then we could form a new group. I think to do this would be our duty as not only publishers of free software but as good citizens too.</div>

"","getting-on-the-treadmill","Getting on the Treadmill","rushabh","","<p>We live in a world of instant gratification and websites are no exception
to this. Most websites selling products (like software) want you to
get some gratification soon. Like, a big green button that will solve all
your problems by signing up or downloading something.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in a product like ERP. There is no instant gratification.
When a customer signs up for an ERP, there is no friends list she can see, 
and there is no easy win. An ERP is a reflection of the user's business. 
And a business is a complex entity and it takes time to setup the system
correctly and get value out of it. We have tried to make the process
as simple as possible, but it still seems a significant task to setup
for a new customer.</p>

<p>To refect this, we have made sure that our website is very informative
and there is no big ""Sign-up"" buttons everywhere like in a traditional
web product. What we want is customers to come to our site, read up
what ERPNext is about and then if they feel they are ready to go
through the grind, can sign-up.</p>

<p>I suspect, most customers read up a lot of information on our site. And
if I were to buy a new ERP for my organization, specially a new one,
I would too. What we lose probably are the customer who want instant
gratification, but at another level, those are customers who probably
are not yet ready for an ERP.</p>

<p>An ERP is like an exercise and diet routine to set your body right. 
There are no quick fixes. You have to get on the treadmill and consistently. 
Over time if you do, you will be in great shape. If you want an instant 
make-over, you might as well go elsewhere.</p>

<p>We are happy serving fewer customers, who really need this product
to get their systems in place. People looking for something instant,
and simpler can signup with the various book-keeping and invoicing apps
out there.</p>

<p>In portuguese, Móveis means furniture. If you don't pay attention to the spelling, you are very likely to confuse it with Movies-Hollywood. Grupo Realize de Móveis is a furniture company based in São Paulo, Brazil.</p>

<p>Grupo Realize started with 1 furniture store and 10 employees and now has grown to include 11 stores and 200 employees. It is interesting to note how they managed to make a monthly turnover of USD 1 million.</p>
<hr>
<p>
    <img src=""https://frappe.erpnext.com/files/grupo_sofa.jpg"">
</p>
<hr>
<p>Mr Antonio Carlos Pavan and Mr Armando Pavan Filho started this company in 2008. At that time, the furniture market was a highly fragmented business. The supply-chain network was unpredictable. In such a scenario these businesses were not able to stick
    to their committed delivery dates. Such delays were the biggest generators of complaints, both official and unofficial. The official complaints lead to lawsuits and bad reputation for most furniture companies.</p>
<p>In this state of chaos, Grupo Realize decided to turn the system on its head. Instead of being bogged down by the lackadaisical delivery system, they used this trait to acquire customers and become more profitable. They offered 50% cash back if they
    did not deliver on the committed time, as a contract in compliance with the consumer protection code. By doing so, they have become a benchmark in the furniture industry. Last month they acquired 250 new customers.</p>

    <img src=""files/grupo_kitchen.png"">
</p>
<p></p>

<h4><hr></h4>


<h4>How can such a scheme be viable?</h4>

<p></p>
<p>The process of how they meet their promises without going bankrupt is worth noting. As a first step to ensure predictability, they make service level agreements with their suppliers and carriers to comply with their Just-In-Time strategy.
    <br>
</p>
<p><br>They execute an order in three stages:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Confirm requirements with the customer.</li>
    <li>Purchase the raw-materials in time, once the requirement is final.</li>
    <li>Arrange and schedule transportation to deliver the product to the customer.<br></li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><br>They have divided teams based on responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>SAC System</b> looks after Customer Service.</li>
    <li><b>Scheduling</b> team manages deadlines.</li>
    <li><b>Conference</b> team ensures the technical specifications of the product.</li>
    <li><b>Assembly</b> team brings together raw materials to make finished goods.</li>
    <li><b>Operations</b> team monitors and supports the above teams.<br></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;""><br>In Brazil, the market benchmark to deliver furniture orders is 70 days. Grupo Realize de Móveis delivers in 30 days.</span>

    <br>
</p>
<p>Additionally, they keep a buffer of 15 days for trouble shooting. In these 15 days, any problem related to lack of specific goods, transport or delivery is solved. Their major challenge is to “douse the last-minute fire”. Orders with last-minute problems
    or shortage of stock at supplier’s end are responsible for most of the delays. Thus, in such problematic situations a separate study is undertaken. Various possible solutions are put forth. Sometimes a discussion takes place with the customer to re-align
    requirements. The solution is then evaluated with the help of cost benefit analysis. Only in complex cases, the operations team takes action to approve a charge out of scope, or negotiate with the customer if there is a possibility of a lawsuit.</p>

<p>Grupo Realize has used the weakest link of the market and created their own unique selling proposition. They have systematised their processes, established SLA’s and aligned various departments with their roles. Today they deal with products that cost

Can they be considered hobbies? Yet, many of the applicants did mention them in their resum&eacute;, during the walk-in recruitment we conducted last week.</p>
<p>A hobby is not an activity you do just because you have some free time. It's what you make yourself free for. No matter what the circumstances, if you want to pursue it, you will find time to do it. You will drown in it. And, you will feel the days worth soar.</p>
<p>It adds a depth to your personality, that no amount of training could. It makes you more engaging; You stand out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some hobbies develop into passions and offer avenues of growth. And it is growth that companies strive for. A company would hire you if you show, in the least, a possibility of such passion. I am yet to see a resum&eacute; which has hobbies mentioned at the top. Wouldn't that make a statement?</p>
<p>Though a small set, I was appalled at the lack of hobbies in the lives of the job applicants. Most of them were in their 20s and sincerely believed that a certification course was the best way to highlight their worth. Some seemed lost, others misguided. I wanted to shake them, make them show their passionate side - yet my subtle hints couldn't breach their hesitation.</p>
<p>The first hobby that I could remember having, was to see my grandmother fix broken things at our home. She was very resourceful. Sometimes, she would guide me and let me take care of a fix. Those moments changed me for good and their lessons still are a big part of who I am. It kept me from losing my curiosity.</p>
<p>Later, I dabbled in computers, drawing and photoshop. Yet, it was when I started reading, that I realized the true meaning and purpose of a hobby - To extend your boundaries. Those stories stretched my imagination and led me on vicarious adventures. It changed the way I thought about my life, beliefs and priorities.</p>
<p>A hobby need not offer relaxation. It is more akin to meditation. Reading those Harry Potter books, during the four day breaks before each engineering exam, wasn't exactly an unwinding experience. It had its tense scenes and sad endings. Yet, it distracted me from the stress of the upcoming exam and kept me from self-destructing (I was not an expert at memorizing texts).</p>
<p>Today, I continue to read, try to capture candid expressions and still in search of the best to-do app. What makes you tick? Please share your hobbies and passions. It may encourage others to make good on theirs.</p>

"","how-erpnext-uses-erpnext","How ERPNext Uses ERPNext","anand","","<p>Every customer uses only 20% of a given product, albeit each a different 20%.
That’s the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle"">Pareto Principle</a>
applied to software.</p>

<p><br>
ERPNext has a lot of features. Which ones do you use? Here’s our 20%.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h4>Communication, Bug Reports, Inquiries and Trial Requests</h4>

<p>Support module was created for our needs, as managing communication with 
customers using individual email accounts was inconvenient and uncoordinated.</p>

<p>Support Ticket system takes care of the coordination issues and helps us 
achieve better response times. Combined with the assignment feature and 
the to-do list, everyone knows where their efforts are required.</p>

<p>When a website visitor contacts us using the contact-us page or signs-up for a 
trial account, a custom code in these web pages creates relevant entries in 
the Support Ticket list (as seen in the picture below). To take it to the 
next level, a custom code runs every hour in the background, looks at the 
Support Ticket list and automatically installs new ERPNext accounts for 
approved Trial Requests. Convenient, isn't it?</p>

alt=""Support Ticket List"" width=""540px""/>
<img src=""https://erpnext.com/files/todo-001.png""
alt=""ToDo List"" width=""540px""/></p>

<p><br></p>

<h4>Sales</h4>

<p>An inquiry on our Support Ticket system or a Trial Request, usually marks 
the beginning of a sale. We create a Lead and track Communications against it. 
Communications generally include a demo of ERPNext and any clarifications 
sought to fit ERPNext to their business model. When the Lead is interested 
in becoming a paid customer, we create an Opportunity and send a Quotation 
for the plan they are interested in. Once they are ready to pay, we create 
a Customer from the Lead and a Sales Order based on the accepted Quotation. 
Once payment is received, we send them a Sales Invoice.</p>

<p><img src=""https://erpnext.com/files/sales process.png""
alt=""Sales"" width=""540px""/></p>

<p><br></p>

<h4>Accounting</h4>

<p>Our accounting entries include payments received from customers and expenses 
like salary, recurring payments on server, sendgrid and google ads, office 
administration expenses, electricty, phone and internet charges and payments 
for goods purchased like air-conditions, furniture, stationary, computers and 
a treadmill (cool, isn’t it!).</p>

<p>We also provide read only access to our accounting, for our auditor’s office. 
Though they are used to working on Tally, they have come to like ERPNext.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h4>Employee Management</h4>

<p>Using the HR module, we maintain Employee information, generate Salary Slips 
and track Attendance (declared mandatory by the government).</p>

<p>Currently, there is no lending system within ERPNext. Hence, to track the 
exchange of books within the company’s library, we record each book as a 
Serial Number, each Employee as a Warehouse and create Stock Entries 
to simulate the flow of books.</p>

<p>We also use the Knowledge Base feature to keep notes and share information.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h4>ERPNext Manages ERPNext</h4>

<p>Before 1st May, 2012, we used to manage our ERPNext accounts via a separate 
system, which we used to call <em>gateway</em>. It was becoming difficult to maintain 
this system. Hence, we decided to manage ERPNext accounts using ERPNext itself.</p>

<p>We have a custom code on our server, which enables us to manage all our 
customers’ accounts from within ERPNext. Once an ERPNext account has been 
setup, a Serial Number entry is created for that account (automatically). 
With the help of Custom Fields, we keep track of configurations like max users, 
max space, expiry date, space consumed etc. for each account. If we extend 
the expiry date for a Serial Number in our ERPNext account, it gets updated 
in the corresponding account via the custom code. (example: our demo account)</p>

<p><img src=""https://erpnext.com/files/serial no.png""
alt=""ERPNext Accounts as Serial Numbers"" width=""540px""/></p>

<p><br></p>

<h4>Website</h4>

<p>Our <em>gateway</em> system was also used to maintain our website. Thus, when 
deprecating the <em>gateway</em> system, we also made ERPNext capable of rendering 
our website.</p>

<p>Our website is generated, entirely, using ERPNext. We realized that building 
a website is an expensive and effortful undertaking for any business, and as 
such, it is not a solved problem. ERPNext provides a standard layout for a 
website, so that, any user could create a pleasant looking website without 
any technical knowledge. With technical knowledge, one can create a much 
complex website.</p>

<p>We also use the blogging system of ERPNext to publish our thoughts, 
discussions and progress.</p>

<p>We have ensured that the Web Pages and Blog entries generated using the 
website module are search-engine friendly.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h4>ERPNext Builds ERPNext</h4>

<p>Here's the best part. Development of a new feature usually starts by 
creating or modifying a DocType record within ERPNext. 
In the DocType form, we configure permissions and fields.
The <em>WN Framework</em> uses this configuration to generate a form.
Then, using javascript (browser-side) and python (server-side) code,
we define the actions, behavior and flow of the elements in the form.</p>

How do you use ERPNext?</p>

"","how-i-met-your-error","How I Met Your Error","anand","","<p></p>
<p>My dearest users,</p>
<p>Prior to the advent of the javascript console, fixing errors was a drag. We had to put up those cryptic crash reports in pop-ups; Not so unlike the blue screen of death!</p>
<p>Also, due to the dynamic, all forgiving nature of javascript, there was never any feedback or error message when it crashed. It would just stop working. You had to be in ""Fire-fighting"" mode, to track what caused the crash.</p>
<p>Thanks to FireBug (an add-on for firefox), it all changed for good. Its console displayed error messages when javascript crashed. Many times, it even pointed us to the exact code that caused the error. Phew!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also started logging server's error reports in the console. It was a dream come true. We only had to look at one place to trace the error.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p><img src=""files/firebugconsole.png"" width=""720"" height=""169"" alt=""FireBug console"" title=""FireBug console"" /></p>
<hr />
<p>WebKit's console (console in chrome/safari) took this game even further. It printed tracebacks of the erroneous script. (A traceback is the sequence of steps that lead to the current error)</p>
<hr />
<p><img src=""files/webkitconsole.png"" width=""800"" height=""113"" alt=""WebKit's Console"" title=""WebKit's Console"" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Developers love precision. We pray for details, error messages and tracebacks. We look for cause and effect. In a dynamic environment consisting of javascript, python and the internet, such feedback keeps frustration at bay.</p>
<p>To err is human; but we don't want forgiveness. We just want to squash these bugs as fast as possible. And we need your help to do that.</p>
<p>So, when faced with an error, please shoot us with details like the steps you followed, your observations, screenshots and the console's output and we shall defend the honour of ERPNext or die trying.</p>
<h4>tl;dr</h4>
<p>An error reported in detail, can keep this humble developer from staying late!</p>

"","how-mysqls-binlogs-saved","How MySQL's BinLogs saved the day","anand","Enable mysql binary log. It might save someone's data and also, your reputation.","<div class=""well"">The takeaway: <br /><br /> Enable mysql binary log. It might save someone's data and also, your reputation.</div>
<p>On the 4th of May 2012, we were attempting to restore a few records for a customer. The basic strategy was to restore a mysql dump into a temporary database and copy those records to the production database.</p>
<p>There was a lot of pressure. It did not help that the customer was annoyed. Not an ideal setting when you are trying to restore something from a database. So, while loading the backup, instead of specifying a temporary database name, I typed in the customer's database! and pressed Enter. It took me about 5 seconds to realize my mistake. I hit Ctrl+C and stopped the process.</p>
<p>Sh**!</p>
<p>To assess the damage, I did a cursory check of the customer's database and thankfully, it seemed I had hit Ctrl+C just in time. Disaster averted. Phew!</p>
<p>After about two weeks, the customer informed us that some of the records in the system were missing. By this time, we had forgotten our misadventure. So we started investigating this issue by searching in the bin-logs. We searched for any delete queries which could've been the cause of the missing records, but we couldn't find any such entry for the customer's database. That was when my mistake came to haunt me.</p>
<p>We checked for drop table queries and we found about 20 such queries being executed on the 4th of May, 2012. Basically, in the 5 seconds before I hit Ctrl+C, data of 20 tables got replaced with the old data from the backup.</p>
<p>In essence, the database now contained entries prior to 30th April, 2012 in those 20 tables and the rest of the database contained all the entries, i.e. the database was partially damaged.</p>
<p>Backups come in handy when you want to restore some records, tables or the whole database. It was useless in our situation, where part of the data was old, part of it was missing and the rest of it was perfectly intact. It would be a monstrous task to sift through backups and identify the ones which were missing or the ones which got replaced with their older versions.</p>
<p>After a lot of discussions, we hit on the idea of using bin-logs to restore the database. bin-logs or binary logs sequentially record DML and DDL statements of all committed transactions, like a tape recorder. We were in for a long day and I was determined to clean up my mess.</p>
<p>The plan was to restore the 30th April backup in a temporary database, apply the statements from the sql file, which we extracted from the bin-logs. Then after 6 PM India Time, when the customer was to stop using the system, apply the remaining latest statements recorded in the bin-logs and then replace this temporary database as the customer's database.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first step was to recognize the query statement in the bin log, which occurred before the 4th of May and after the timestamp of the 30th April backup. We used this timestamp to locate the statement which was executed after the backup was taken. This step took about an hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We then extracted all the statements after and including the located statement, from the bin-logs and redirected the output to a .sql file. The sql file had about three weeks worth of sql statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next step was to remove the statements which caused the damage. Only one problem. The size of the file was 1.4 GB, and contained about 43.7 million lines. The process of removing those sql statements, including any statements containing ""use database"", was extremely slow. We were using vim over an ssh connection. One of the cpu cores of our server kept maxing out. Each time we saved the file, we had to wait about 15-20 minutes for the process to complete. Every search operation on the file took about 5 minutes. It required a lot of patience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After scrubbing the sql file, applying this file on the backup took several iterations. This was mainly due to some internal mysql commands, which got recorded in the bin-logs and were causing conflicts. We kept resolving these conflicts and successfully applied the extracted statements on the backup. Phew! But it took 6 hours to do all this.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At about 8 PM India Time, we applied the customer's latest changes and replaced their database with the one we restored. It worked perfectly. All the missing records were there.</p>
<p>Lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>When in pressure, take a break.</li>
<li>Do not meddle with databases on a friday evening. The consequences can be haunting.</li>
<li>Make sure that bin-logs and backups are working, everyday.</li>
<li>and lastly, prevention wastes a lot less time than a cure.</li>

"","how-to-take-your","How to take your company online","anand","I realized that many businesses have difficulties, when it comes to creating an online presence. Hence, I am listing here, an overview to ta","<p>A few days back, one of my friends asked me to help him figure out, how he could send emails to his customers using an address like first<em>name@company</em>name.com</p>
<p>Even I was not aware of how to do such a thing, when I joined this company 10 months back. Thanks to working on erpnext.com, I was able to help my friend. He was relieved to find that establishing such an email address was very easy and cheap. And he could maintain it on his own.</p>
<p>Further, he wanted to send a marketing email to his customers every month and ensure that it gets delivered. His eyes lit up when I told him, that he could not only track, if the email got delivered, but also track which link (if any) were clicked by the users. This statistics could help him gauge the interest of his customers and help him do better marketing.</p>
<p>As his interest grew, I realized that many businesses have similar desires and difficulties, when it comes to creating an online presence. Hence, I am listing here, an overview to take your company online, the way erpnext.com did (with some improvements).</p>
<h4>1. Get a domain name</h4>
<p>You can buy a domain name for your company like your<em>company.com or your</em>company.co.in at a domain registrar's website like http://www.namecheap.com, http://www.bigrock.com, etc. You have to pay yearly charges to maintain your domain's registration. The pricing starts at about $2 for the least popular top-level domains (TLD - eg. .co.in, .in, .info) and increases with popularity (eg. .com, .net)</p>
<h4>2. Create a google apps account (Free - for upto 10 users)</h4>
<p>Go to http://www.google.com/a/, click on Solutions and select Google Apps (Free) and get started.</p>
<p>While registering for Google Apps, you will need to specify the domain name that you own. Google will ask you to create one or more DNS resource records in your domain registrar's DNS management system.</p>
<p>A DNS resource record is essentially a record which tells your browser, to go to a specified server when you type www.your_company.com in the browser's address bar.</p>
<p>It will then try to verify if the domain is actually owned by you. Here is the help on how to get your domain be successfully verified: http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=60216 The easiest option is to add a TXT record in your DNS management system.</p>
<p>You can find detailed help on getting started with google apps, here: http://support.google.com/a/</p>
<h4>3. Use an email marketing tool to send newsletters</h4>
<p>Tools like http://www.madmimi.com, http://www.mailchimp.com, etc. let you easily create beautiful newsletters to send to your customers. They provide analytics like number of opened emails, links clicked, number of bounced emails etc. Full list of features and pricing can be found on their websites. Since they are whitelisted on many popular ISP&rsquo;s and email providers, there is a low probability of getting your emails sent to the spam folder, unless the user explicitly marks your mail as spam (which can also be tracked).</p>
<p>In summary, a highly effective marketing tool. (We are thinking about implementing this feature in erpnext in the future)</p>
<h4>4. Website</h4>
<p>One can start with a basic website containing four pages. A home page, an about us page, a contact us page and a products page / features page.</p>
<p>Initially, your contact us page can mention an email address, which can be used to contact you. Now a days, people expect a clearly mentioned pricing scheme on the website, if it is possible.</p>
<p>You will need to build a website and buy web hosting to host this website. There are plenty of hosting providers which have competitive pricing and minimal downtime.</p>
<p>Content Management Systems like Wordpress and Joomla, if used to build your website, let you easily maintain your websites yourselves, if you think that your website will need frequent changes.</p>
<p>In erpnext, there is a website module which has been created specifically for this reason. It allows you to create your own standard website and blog without any hassles of hiring a web developer or buying any hosting space. (http://frappe.erpnext.com/#!setting-up-your-website)</p>
<h4>5. Social Networking</h4>
<p>Using twitter.com, you can post short news, anecdotes and links to keep your customers updated. (At least those who follow you on twitter).</p>
<p>However, nothing beats content. Writing blog posts which help spread knowledge and awareness or the ongoings in the company can lead to popularity among your customers. Most search engines improve your rankings based on how authentic your content is and how relevant or recent it is.</p>
<h4>6. Web based business management</h4>
<p>The biggest advantage of taking your company online is the accessibility and the flexibility you get in return.</p>
<p>Using Google Docs, you can collaborate and create documents on the go, without worrying about installing any software.</p>
<p>You can setup an e-commerce / webshop to make it easy for your customers to buy your products / services. It also boosts sales and lowers cost.</p>
<p>Web based solutions to perform accounting, manage projects, inventory, sales and purchase make it very easy to keep your data updated on a daily basis. ERPNext is one such product among many available.</p>
<p>You should choose a product which suits your business process as closely as possible and fits your criteria. Using the right tools is the key to informed progress and predictability.</p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">My dependence on Google is scary. I cannot image how much I will lose if I lose my GMail account. Make me wonder how much control of your life are you willing to give to large companies such as Google? When will security and ownership outshine convenience?</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">And why this dichotomy? As technology gets more and more advanced and widespread, more people should start providing services and it should become easy for anyone to start their own service, like say GMail or provide a directory of the web that is searchable. Why are there such few good alternatives?</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I started thinking doing some small experiments.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">First, I changed my default search from Google to DuckDuckGo (DDG), the alternate search engine run by Gabriel Weinberg. He started this as a personal project and is now serving upwards of 2 million queries a day. After using the service for a few days, I realized that Google serves better results in more than 75% of my queries. For example, Google is far more likely to return an “official website” of a product or a forum that is more widely read.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So this brought me to the next conclusion, Google Search is so good because we have trained it for so many years. It was not obvious to me earlier, but every time you punch in a few characters in Google Search box, you are telling Google something. Every time you select a result, Google knows you voted for it. The more number of people search for something, the better it usually is. So Google is actually better because more people use it.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Same with GMail and other services. Google knows what is spam because we diligently mark spam. Its machine learning (ML) algorithms are learning with every action I make. So in a way I am making Google better by using it. Google is learning to manage its server in the big bad world of the internet. It knows how to defend against attacks, it has sophisticated system to monitor breaches. It knows all of this because it has so many users. And this is making it harder for anyone to provide half a decent service, increasing our dependence on Google many fold.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Please note that I have nothing against Google. We are caught in a vicious cycle, where we are giving huge amount of data to a private company to and making their products better. Now what would happen if we gave this data to an open source company? The knowledge embedded in that product would become community property and anyone with would be able to setup their own email servers or web indexes.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The size of opportunity we are losing by not doing this is nothing short of a grand tragedy. Taking this analogy to ERPNext, we feel a bit better. All the users, whether they buy our hosting or they use on their own are “training” ERPNext to be a better product. Every feedback we get (and we get tons) is making the product better. Hence we love our free users (almost) as much as our paid ones.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Can we extend the idea to other products? How about EMail? How about web indexes? Personally I would love if there was an easy mailbox I could install on my computer and along with a cloud based directory service (DNS), so that all my mails would directly drop in on my machine. I could couple this with a simple backup service, or a spare hard disk so that I have copies in case my main hard disk crashes.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The reality is that it is extremely hard to do this at the moment. Logically it makes complete sense, but there is no such alternative. Opportunity anyone?</span></p>

We had keyed in a lot of live data. I should say it is a good software. However I feel that there needs to be a lot of discipline in the organization to be able to implement this solution well which I feel we are
            not ready as yet.</em><div><div><em>
        <div>
            <br>
        </div>

        <div><em>We regret to inform you that we will be unable to go ahead in implementing this.”</em>

        <h4>So When is a Company Ready for an ERP?</h4><div><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;"">If we further dig into Bob's feedback, we understand that he dropped ERP implementation because of lack of standard procedures in his operations. Like Bob, most of the companies abandon ERP implementation because ERP product is not perfectly mapped
            with their not-so-generic workflow. In my home country, companies shelve ERP implementation because their employees are just so comfortable with the widely used standard accounting application.</span></div>
        <div>
            <br>
        </div>
        <h4>Do You Need Discipline?</h4>
        <div>For lack of discipline, I believe bringing standardization in business processes is the primary goal any ERP solution would achieve for a company. For example, if a company wishes to bring in discipline that invoices should not be made till its delivery note is punched
            in, putting restriction in software would be simpler than controlling human behaviour of employees.</div>
        <div>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div>Employees will initially believe that using software is taking longer time in feeding data into system. But they mostly fail to envision benefits of investing that extra effort. ERP application should <i>not</i> be looked
            as a tool which puts business on auto-pilot mode. Using an ERP application is like running on a tread-mill. The extra pain you put helps in bringing discipline in your operations and ensure that your processes leads to healthy and consistence growth of organization.</div>
        <div>
            <br>
        </div><h4>Walk Before You Run</h4>
        <div>Another breed of entrepreneurs are the ones who have their business running on spreadsheets and they want to jump to an application which will bring complete automation. But sir, journey of thousand miles starts with first step. Start with that single step.</div>
        <div>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div>If you go about searching for an application which manages your accounting, and at the same time should address to problem of pilferage in your warehouse by having surveillance system in place, you can search across the world to get solution for everything
            in one system available off-the-shelf for the price of a soda. There is very little chance that your search will meet a successful end!</div>

                </div>
                <div>And my special regards to those employers who don’t want to trouble their employees by implementing ERP application just because their employees <a href=""https://erpnext.com/upgrade"">have become used to an existing application</a>.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Keep Innovating</h4>
                <div>A very smart saying I heard in the promos of quiz contest said, if you stop learning, you stop winning. If vehicle stops mid way while climbing bridge, it is automatically dragged down and stops much before the start point.</div>
                <div>
                    <br>
                </div>
                <div>Also, there are many other reasons due to which small businesses restrain from implementing ERP solution. To list a few more:</div>
                <div>
                    <br>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Print formats are my religion. Get me exactly same output from your system.</li>
                        <li>I won’t migrate from existing application. Can you merge your application with mine?</li>
                        <li>Guys, you don’t have jazzy graphs.</li>
                        <li>Come over to my place and implement solution. I want ERP but not ready to take implementation pain.</li>
                        <li>I need customization.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So, if I start searching for silver bullets answer to these questions, I am so sure I will keep searching.</p>
                    <p>If you think customization would be solution to get required solution, it is correct, with few limitations. One of our customer who had customized application found that over a period of time, that technology was out dated. When using product, it allows
                        you to avail upgrades of software and ensure you are up to date on technology front as well.</p>
                    <p>After two years experience of implementing ERPs for SME, I believe that ERP should be seen more than just an integrated software to digitize your information. It should be seen as tool to grow your business.<br>
                    </p>

"","if-my-car-had-an-api","If My Car Had An API","anand","","<p>A year ago, I bought a 6 year old used car - a Maruti Suzuki Swift ZXi. It was surprisingly well maintained and I was satisfied with the deal. Recently, when my cousin got a newer version of the same car, I was thrilled to see its improved visual appeal.</p>
<p>Once my initial impression faded, I realised that there were no improvements in the ownership experience, nothing to entice me into buy this new version. It had the same fuel gauges and speedometers. All indicators were still analog. I still couldn't figure out how much fuel exists in the car, just that level in the tank is about halfway. You only know the battery is dead when it is actually dead. The engine is still hot or cool or in between. Your laptop has better sensors than these.</p>
<p>And don't get me started on the car's stereo! A USB interface, that is the only new thing they can add in 7 years?.</p>
<p>It was like the automobile industry stopped innovating for the affordable segment. Maybe, they never realised that there are new low-hanging fruits to take care of.</p>
<p>As a car owner, there are 3 things that I am usually worried about. (apart from it getting damaged or stolen!)</p>
<ol>
<li>Did I lock my car?</li>
<li>What if my car gets towed? How will I know where to look for it?</li>
<li>What is the amount of fuel remaining in the tank?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think these problems could be solved using digital sensors, a standardised API and a tablet. Feed the sensor data into a tablet with internet access and let software take care of the rest.</p>
<p>You could check if your car is locked using your smartphone (something like lockitron). You could be warned if your car is towed or stolen. You could get accurate mileage, diagnostics, maintenance alerts and consequently lower the cost of ownership. Given the API, the open source hardware community will make things that will shock the world.</p>
<p>I could make this blog too long to read, if I enumerate all the possibilities I can think of.</p>
<p>In sum, just put some digital sensors, provide a standardised API and the rest will follow. In their fast lives, a lot of people will have some peace of mind.</p>
<p>Edit:&nbsp;<br />Thanks Arun for pointing it out. Ford has created an API - <a href=""http://openxcplatform.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://openxcplatform.com/</a><br />I wish it comes installed by default for all cars</p>","2013-02-08",1,"Technology"

"","indias-got-talent","India's Got Talent","rushabh","Inside ERPNext: Meeting candidates of all types during our recent walk-in interviews.","<p>Akhilesh walks into our small meeting room. He is young and slim, with a pimpled face, spiked hair and an earring that tells me he's a rebel. “You got 3 out of 20 in the Aptitude test. Thats the lowest so far. Even if you had answered the questions randomly, you should have got 5.”, I tell him as he walks in. Its the second day of walk-in interviews for software developers. Before the interview, the candidates give an aptitude test with standard math, technical and logical questions. Akhilesh is probably the twentieth, or thirtieth young kid, fresh out of college who has taken the test, and the response has been disappointing so far. With my new found love for writing, I have also slipped in a writing question. Akhilesh writes in his essay that whatever they have taught him in college is trash. And it is clearly showing. Just when I am about to dismiss him, he tells me that he has written an ERP application on his own. Yeah right. Most kids have not even heard of an ERP. Maybe its a desperate move. “Why don’t you bring it on your laptop tomorrow if you really have made such an application. I am open to seeing it.”, I tell him before showing him the door.</p><p>Hiring talented engineers is the Achilles heels for small software companies in India. Most bright young engineers want to work for the best companies in the world like Google, and if not those, then the best ones in India, like Infosys or TCS. Even those companies are constantly cribbing about the lack of genuine talent and employable candidates. The reasons are obvious and listed on many forums. Engineering colleges are mushrooming all over India like weeds, what is taught in those colleges has no bearing on reality, the students are evaluated on rote learning (or copying) skills and the professors are those, who are usually unqualified to be placed in companies. Apart from a few elite colleges, what you get is a batch of disillusioned young kids who are suddenly thrown in to the real world without a parachute.</p><p>There are other factors too. There is a wide gap between kids of high and low income families. Kids who come from high income families are Anglophones, very confident and aspire to work in multi-national corporations. They look down upon the vernaculars, kids who come from lower income groups, speak bad English and lack confidence. The kind of candidates that are in demand are those who belong to the higher income group. And we were sure that those candidates would never work in a nameless, if not faceless, startup like us. What we were looking for was raw talent, the kind that slips through the cracks. But it was turning out to be like finding a needle in the haystack. The candidates that we were getting, were mostly fresh out of college and had been unable to find a job for many months.</p><p>Sunil had scored 15 in the aptitude test. The highest so far. He was tall and confident, with his combed hair and a full sleeved shirt. “Sunil, you are the brightest of the lot so far, but why did you not attempt any technical question?”. He says that he is not sure about web development. But many of the questions, like how do you check if a user has entered a valid email address, were not web related, so I persisted. “Do you practice writing code in your free time?” was my next question. I found this question to be the fastest way to cut the chase. “Yes I read about code”. This is the standard answer most candidates gave. Which is like reading about riding a professional bike, when you can barely balance yourself on one. “Sunil, you are such a bright kid”, I tell him, “why don’t you practice by doing some personal projects?. I can’t take you unless you know how to write code.”. Before leaving, he tells me that he is very keen on working and will be happy if I can spare him an hour to help him get started on code.</p><p>On the third day, so many candidates come in, that we have to borrow chairs from our neighbouring office. To speed up the process, we decide to ditch the aptitude test and directly take quick interviews. Anand and myself sit in the cabin and ask the candidates to come in one by one. It was not unlike a television reality talent show where anyone who wants instant fame, walks in front of celebrity judges. In our office, we rarely get to meet people, since our customers are all online. So this was turning out to be an interesting experience. We saw people of a wide variety come in. Some of the stark realities of India were also on display. Many girls, specially from lower income groups, were clearly malnourished and appeared stunted compared to the boys, who seemed heftier, showing India’s preference for children of one gender. India’s lust for the Queen’s language was also in clear display. I felt for the vernacular candidates not only appeared unsure of their answers but also looked scared, maybe for life.</p><p>We made sure that we conducted the interviews in Hindi, which we speak in office anyways, and tried our best to make the candidates feel at ease, by calling them by their name and slipping in the occasional joke. There were couple of candidates that would haunt me for time to come. One was a boy who was job hunting for three years. Thats right, all he did in three years was job hunting. Apart from his greying hair at such a young age, he seemed physically okay to me. I looked at his resume, and asked him whether he had got an offer for a data entry type of position at least. He said he got those offers but he wanted to be a developer. Did he do any personal projects to demonstrate his skills in those three years? No. “Rohan, promise me that once you go out of this office, you will take up the first job offer you get, no matter what position. If not for your sake but for the sake of your family.” I was hoping I had put it clearly enough to him. He smiled at me, looked at the floor and gave a small nod.</p><p>The other candidate was a girl, who again was vernacular and spoke very bad English and had a terrifying blank look on her face as she walked in. To make her feel better, I told her that its okay to speak in Hindi. That probably made her even more nervous, and she started speaking in even worse English, ignoring my attempt to rescue her. I wanted to end the interview, but it would be really bad for her confidence if I rejected her straight away, so I asked a few basic questions so she could feel a bit confident. To her credit she did answer some questions, but as soon as I asked her to write a query, she froze and her fingers started shaking visibly. I let the moment linger for a bit. I kept staring at her fingers. I did not have the heart to reject her so finally I told her to leave her resume and that we would contact her if we found her good enough.</p><p>Saurabh was the most interesting candidate of the lot. Short and stocky with thick glasses, he had a smile on his face as he walked in. He told me that he read sorting algorithms for fun, so I told him to explain one to me, which he did alright to his credit. After that I asked him what his interests were. He told me that he liked reading history. Being a history buff myself, it was indeed interesting. I asked him what he read last. “Last I read was a book about the final battle of Panipat in which the Marathas where defeated by the Afghan raider Ahmed Shah.” Which year? I asked him, as I flipped open my laptop to fire up Wikipedia. “Can’t say exactly, but it was probably 1770”. Not bad. The decline of the Marathas just before the British Empire was something I had been wanting to find out more about and this was turning out to be a good interview. “So what do you think of the British rule of India, was it good or bad?”. It was a typical bait for an emotional answer. “It was both” he replied confidently, “the British managed to unite the country and also brought in modern governance and infrastructure like the railways. But they also exploited and enslaved us and drained our economy. So in balance its a tough call.”. Not bad for confidence either. I finally let him go by promising him that I would call again for another interview and ask him to write real code.</p><p>We got some English speaking candidates too, just a handful. After taking fifty interview, you can tell a lot by the way someone walks in. These candidates were really smart, talked in great English and with a lot of confidence. But these were also candidates who were out to be project managers in large companies. They were interviewing because either they were benched or they were laid off from some of the recent e-commerce disasters. And they were over-confident. They came with the view that they are going to ace the interview. “So what did you work on your last project, Shahana?”. “I did a project for a University Management System based on Java Struts and Hibernate”. “I am sorry I don’t understand that, can you explain? Did you write any code?”. “Er, I wrote some code to map classes to objects”. “Map classes to objects? Are you sure?”. It was clear she had no idea was she was talking about.</p><p>At the end of the third day, we are really tired. I was hoping that I was not becoming snarky like the celebrity judges on television shows. Just then Akhilesh, the candidate with the spiked hair, walks in with his laptop to show his ERP. He opens his laptop and fires up the application. It starts with a smart login screen and I am already suspicious whether this is something he has made, it seems too good to be true. After login, the application seems to be quite complete. He starts showing us the menus, there are masters, customer, supplier, products and sales and purchase transactions. Anand appreciates the wooden wallpaper of the application. I ask him to enter some transactions. He makes a new product and it goes through okay. He then enters a sales transaction and the application appears to crash. Now we will find out, I think, as I ask him to debug this. He then fires up Visual Basic and starts debugging the application, deftly using keyboard shortcuts and code searches. Anand and myself look at each other in surprise. We ask him more questions and he seems to be genuine. He says, he made the ERP for the company his father worked in. Wow, he’s scored the lowest in the aptitude test, I tell myself, most companies would just throw him away. I cannot hold the excitement anymore and ask him to excuse us for a moment. As soon as he leaves the room, Anand confirms my enthusiasm and he also thinks this is exactly what we were looking for.</p><p>Like most candidates he is job hunting at the moment and is ready to join us anytime. I ask Prakash to prepare an offer letter immediately. Something about the television show setting tells me that the judgement has to be pronounced immediately, no point sleeping over this. I see that he is as excited as we are and this will probably be his first real job. I am sure that we have finally discovered raw talent and already start thinking about what will be the best way to integrate him in the real world. The raw talent needs to be polished too.</p><p>As he leaves, it suddenly strikes me that if you remove his pimples, he looks exactly like David Heinemeier Hansson, the famous hacker who created Ruby on Rails and is a partner in 37signals, our role models. Was this for real?</p><p>Post Script: We ended up hiring Akhilesh and Saurabh.</p>","2013-02-16",1,"Inside ERPNext"
"","internet-security","Internet Security","rushabh","Reflections on Internet security after an eventful week.","<div>This turned out to be an hell of a week for internet security. It is one of those things where we look for patterns in co-incidence. Till now internet security was only of a passing concern for me because we never thought we were big enough (yet) to be attacked. But it turned out, I was wrong.</div><div><br></div><div><b>We got hacked.</b></div><div><br></div><div>It was a crude attack. The hacker used a standard php (php is the technology that powers a lot of standard applications like forums, website management tools etc) exploit to enter in our system and tried to steal some data and damage our site. Thankfully what saved us was that since we have built our own infrastructure, the hacker was not able to understand our architecture (apparently he did not checkout our code, or did not understand it) so he (I am assuming its a he, but could be a she as well) ended up causing limited damage. Not to say that the hacker failed. We are pretty sure he stole some data, but thankfully he was not able to locate client data so we got lucky. By the time he came back for more, we had already plugged the hole.</div><div><br></div><div>The irony is that we do not use php, but for some reason, one of our past team members had installed phpMyAdmin (a utility to browse databases) and we had deleted that application, but forgot to switch off the php module.</div><div><br></div><div>So who was this hacker and what was the intent?</div><div><br></div><div>Here is my theory, it seems that the hacker was looking for credit card information, since we sell something online or was looking for data he could sell, like verified email address (that can be spammed) or he was looking to install malware on our server that he can then use for other purposes. We identified at least four different IP address the hacker used. They were from Khakhastan, Egypt, Pakistan and China. I am sure these are proxies and some of them belong to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that use NAT (a technology where they assign IPs dynamically to their customers, so its hard to say which customer was using it unless you have their logs).</div><div><br></div><div>Just to clarify, we do not store any credit card information of our customers or their passwords, most our transactions happen via PayPal and they have the credit card information. Each customer database is separate and all private data is stored separately on individual databases.</div><div><br></div><div>Based on what we saw, we believe that the hacker was most likely Indian, because the intrusion script that he used, had some Indian names. We need to find out the source of that intrusion script and maybe then we can be able to locate more clearly where this hacker came from. When we searched on the net, this exploit was used to hack many popular web applications and such compromises happen routinely.</div><div><br></div><div>Either ways, this incident came as a wake up call to us. We had always heard that a counter culture exists that thinks its cool to attack companies and governments, but this was a first hand encounter. We will now take security much more seriously.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Surveillance</b></div><div><br></div><div>The second event of note this week was that Hacker News (the #1 forum for technology) was full stories regarding a startling leak that the United States Government is engaged in widespread surveillance of mostly non-US and US citizens through major services like telcos, Google, Facebook and others. A wild debate raged on civil liberties and whether the US government has crossed some kind of a line and if this was true, then there was no such thing privacy on the internet.</div><div><br></div><div>They way it works is this, if you have been “black listed” as a potential harm to US interests, the US security agency is going to go after all your data. For non-US citizens using US services like Google and Facebook, such requests do not even require basic scrutiny. If you are a US citizen, does not mean they will allow your privacy, but there are some checks and balances in place to minimize misuse. So by your bad luck, or bad chance you exchanged some emails with some black listed accounts, you are probably under surveillance.</div><div><br></div><div>So what does this mean for us, specially non-US users? We use Google services all the time and GMail is particularly the weak link. I think in the near future, it should become pertinent for all of us to use a variety of services for mail rather than just GMail. We need to setup our own email boxes with 3rd party backups so that we do not handover full control of our lives to Google. I think our mailboxes are our most critical digital assets and we should be taking better care of them. This may sound paranoid, but is at least worthy of a thought.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Getting Serious about Security</b></div><div><br></div><div>This brings me to the third incident this week. Since we won a prize few weeks back by creating a better visualization of Indian Government data, we got in touch with a few of the engineers behind the open data initiative (data.gov.in). The first thing a users sees when going on the site is that the SSL certificate is not verified by the browser. When I asked the engineers about this, they told me that Mozilla and Chrome does not identify the Indian government agency as a valid certifying agency and they told that people like me should be lobbying.</div><div><br></div><div>Now I felt this to be a bit odd because Mozilla is a well respected non-profit and there should not be any such trouble. I did a few web searches and realized that there is a procedure that needs to be followed to apply as a certifying agency with Mozilla. So if the government is serious about this, it should follow the steps.</div><div><br></div><div>This also shows that the Indian government is not really serious about web security. Here we are talking about setting up our own mail servers, and thousands of Government officials use Google and Microsoft email accounts to transact official work. This is ridiculous and its time the Indian government wakes up to take charge of its own digital assets and sets its house in order.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Closing Thoughts</b></div><div><br></div><div>This week I got a clearer idea of what internet security means. Digital assets are just like physical assets and are prone to theft and damage. If you let your physical assets be stolen, most likely the will be. We usually take commonsense precautions why protecting physical assets, and the same has to be with digital assets. If you are storing digital assets for someone else, you are more likely to be attacked and hence you need to be even more cautious. Some basic precautions are:</div><div><br></div><div><ol><li><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;"">Maintaining a minimal and secure server setup.

"","inventory-valuation-method:-fifo","Inventory Valuation Method - FIFO vs. Moving Average","nabin","What is Valuation Method? Difference between FIFO vs. Moving Average.","<h4>What is inventory valuation?</h4>
<p><br /> Inventory valuation is the cost of unsold goods in a company&rsquo;s inventory. It includes all costs incurred to get the item ready for sale, like material expenses, direct labour, freight, handling, import duties etc.</p>
<p>Inventory is an&nbsp;important asset on the company&rsquo;s balance sheet for small and medium businesses. So, it is very important to calculate correct inventory value.</p>
<p>There are several valuation methods, but for small businesses, it is generally restricted to FIFO and Moving Average.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>FIFO (First In First Out):</h4>
<p><br /> In&nbsp;FIFO&nbsp;it is assumed that, in a warehouse, items that arrive first, are sold first. Hence, it is calculated by summing the actual cost of the stock of an item, available in the warehouse.</p>
<pre><code>FIFO stock value = Qty1 * Rate1 + Qty2 * Rate2 + ...
</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Moving Average:</h4>
<p><br /> In&nbsp;Moving&nbsp;Average,&nbsp;the value of an item&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;average&nbsp;cost&nbsp;weighed&nbsp;by&nbsp; the&nbsp;quantities&nbsp;available in the warehouse.</p>
<pre><code>Moving Average Rate = (
    (Available Qty in stock * Average Rate)
    + (Incoming Stock * Incoming Rate)) /
    (Available Qty in Stock + Incoming Stock)
</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p><br /> Now we will take an example and see the impact on valuation using FIFO and Moving Average. Lets assume the following transactions happened with item A:</p>
<pre><code>Date        Transaction     Quantity    Unit Cost($)
01-01-2012  Purchase        10          12
03-01-2012  Purchase        5           15
10-01-2012  Sales           12          ?
</code></pre>
<p><strong>On 03-01-2012:</strong></p>
<p>Stock Value as per FIFO = (10 * 12) + (5 * 15) = $ 195</p>
<p>Valuation Rate as per Moving Average = (10 * 12 + 5 * 15)/(10+5) = $ 13 Stock value as per Moving Average = (15 * 13) = $ 195</p>
<p><strong>On 10-01-2012:</strong></p>
<p>12 qty sold.</p>
<p>As per FIFO, 10 qty @ $12 and 2 qty @ $15 will been considered for sale. Stock Value for remaining stock as per FIFO = (3 * 15) = $ 45</p>
<p>But in case of Moving Average any 12 item can be sold at an average cost $13 Valuation Rate for remaining stock as per Moving Average = $ 13 Stock value as per Moving Average = (3 * 13) = $ 39</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Advantages and Disadvantages:</h4>
<p><br /> In real world, generally price of the item rises over time, so products that come into inventory earlier have lower cost than newer&nbsp;ones. That&rsquo;s why using FIFO, valuation rate generally shows higher value compared to moving&nbsp;average, and&nbsp;hence higher gross profit and net income.</p>
<p>On the other hand, since it increases gross profit and income, it also increases tax liabilities to the company.</p>
<p>Determining the average unit cost of goods available for sale effectively smoothes any price fluctuations in a material that may occur. That&rsquo;s why, if cost of any item fluctuates very regularly, it is recommended to use moving average method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What if stock goes into negative?</h4>
<p><br /> Negative stock is only allowed if valuation method is Moving Average. If stock goes into negative, stock value treated as zero. When stock comes back to positive, valuation rate is again calculated for positive qty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What happens&nbsp;when back-dated entries&nbsp;are&nbsp;made?</h4>
<p><br /> Posting date and time of any stock transaction plays a vital role in calculating stock value on a given date. If there is any back-dated entry entered in the system, then the&nbsp;valuation for all the future transactions from that date should be recalculated.</p>

<p>Today I succesfully completed my first project <strong>""Backup Manager""</strong> which takes backups of your database and then automatically uploads it to your Dropbox &amp; Google Drive account. After a week of struggle with Dropbox and Google Drive API's, I finally made my first contribution to ERPNext app module. This project really tested my patience and programming skills. It happened many times that i got stuck on silly mistakes and frustation was in its peek, solution was in front of me but still not able to catch it. Working on python was a whole new experience for me. This project taught me alot and I hope for more new experiences in future.</p>
<p>Now c<span style=""font-size: 11.5px;"">oming back to application</span><span style=""font-size: 11.5px;"">&nbsp;the question comes ""How they will integrate Backup Manager with app module"".

However, it would be foolish to ","<p>Most of you must have wondered whether ERPNext is a secure application. We even think twice before putting our personal data online today. An ERP software is used for storing sensitive financial data, and it's bound to evoke a feeling of insecurity when using a cloud based ERP.</p>
<p>The realm of computer security has many unknowns and as such, even the most secure systems get compromised. However, it would be foolish to keep known security holes open for attack. So, let me enlist some of the steps we have taken to ensure your data's security.</p>
<h4>We do not store passwords in plain text</h4>
<p>i.e. All passwords are encrypted and cannot be read/recovered by anyone. How does this work? Wikipedia: Cryptographic Hash Functions</p>
<h4>Authentication is secured using SSL (https)</h4>
<p>Even the sub-domain login pages use secured authentication. Our SSL certificate is provided by RapidSSL.</p>
<h4>Transparency during support activity</h4>
<p>Since we host your data, we have access to it. Don't worry! We acknowledge your concern and thus, our system is configured, such that we cannot login to your application without informing you via email. This ensures high transparency while ensuring a quick and smooth support process.</p>
<h4>Daily Backups</h4>
<p>Another aspect of security is the ability to recover your data in case of a disaster. We take daily backup of your database and store it on Amazon S3, a widely used secure cloud storage service. However, as an added safety measure, we recommend that you take manual backups of your database via Tools &gt; Download Backup. You will be emailed a link to the backup file, which remains active for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Our application is not perfect. But it is better than ever. We are actively looking out for security holes to plug. Our development and release process have taken a more responsible direction. And we have a small and trustworthy team.</p>
<p>We love to discuss ideas. Please drop in a comment or two.</p>
<p>The best software is one which solves your problems with the least possible pain. We hope you have a good time using our application.</p>","2012-05-01",1,"ERPNext Features"

It is the story of why and how Linux came to be, and a window into the mind of a creative genius.</div><div><br></div><div>The book starts off with an unusual topic: the meaning of life. It is something that engenders convoluted answers from even the most diligent philosophers. Yet Linus's theory seems refreshing and original-that every phenomenon in life progresses from survival to social order, and then to entertainment. We're all here to have fun.</div><div><br></div><div>Linus recounts his life at school as a typical nerd: good at math and physics, not so stellar in the social circle. Someone who was perfectly happy in his room, at the computer, cloning various games and tinkering under the hood. <i>""No fun could compare to computer fun"".&nbsp;</i></div><div><br></div><div>From the cover, you would think that this book would be just about the making of the operating system, but it is also gives us a glimpse into Linus's family, the advanced state of education in Finland, his experience at the army, general traits of its people and their affinity to technology.</div><div><br></div><div>He then goes to unfold the story of his association to computers, from the first one-his maternal grandfather's Commodore VIC-20, to a Sinclair QL, and eventually a 386 PC, on which, the Linux operating system came to life. Even the tale of deciding on such purchases and financing them is intriguing.</div><div><br></div><div>He wrote his own programming tools from a driver to a floppy controller, editor, assembler and disassembler. (And now I feel ashamed that all I did was complain about the lack of a driver for my HP printer). His interest in Operating Systems grew further when he started to understand Unix. To him, Unix was beautiful - a system that gave you the building blocks that are sufficient for doing everything.</div><div><br></div><div>Linux got started as a project to create a terminal emulator to replace the one provided with Minix, while Linus was studying at the University of Helsinki. He also wrote a disk driver, so that he could download/upload files to a university computer. Realising its potential to become a complete operating system, he read and implemented POSIX system calls and eventually got a shell running - in just a few months! To put it in perspective, to compile the Linux operating system source code is pretty complicated; Just imagine how incredibly skilled he must be to write it.</div><div><br></div><div><i>""In a software kind of world, I find that once you solve the fundamental problems of a project, it's easy to lose interest.""</i></div><div>Any programmer would identify with this statement.</div><div><br></div><div>He regales us with the events proceeding the release of Linux to the world: the Minix vs. Linux flamefest, how he met his wife, the case of the Linux trademark, adopting the GPL license, moving to Silicon Valley to work at Transmeta Corp. and his meeting with Steve Jobs. With Linux's meteoric rise to fame, he also sheds light on the pressure of denying millions of dollars to make sure that he remains neutral.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>His views on Intellectual Property, companies trying to control things out of fear and why open source makes sense, seem to be prophetic in light of recent events like the Samsung vs. Apple case or the Oracle vs Google one. At the end, he comes full circle to his idea about the meaning of life-that Linux offers both social motivation and entertainment, and that having fun is a better motivator than money, when survival is more or less assured.</div><div><br></div><div>This book is a chronicle filled with wit and humour.

And continuous quirky sound from our ceiling does worst possible to our programmers. Our programmers were ""distracted"" with that sound. Some living being had trespassed into our office! With spying mode activated, in no time, all of us were junior Hercule Poirot, without moustaches, searching for clue to understand and locate the intruder. Initial clues found above washroom suggested that its a RAT. Rushabh started browsing through our library section. And his heart broke to see his favourite companion (books) under thick surface of dust.<div><br></div><div>And here comes a new personality grooming exercise for rest of us. One book read in a month with ""quality"" book review as a blog.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Book: What the Customer Wants You to Know&nbsp;</div><div>Author: Ram Charan&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This book teaches us that selling in not just an activity of defining 4P’s and going after customers pitching your standard solution. Sales is about being one step ahead in understanding your customer’s need and define your offerings accordingly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Generally company’s showcase their credentials like long existence in industry and expertise when promoting their offerings. But customer will never show interest in your product just because you are into business since 19##. Or you have expertise in certain technology and can provide end-to-end solution. Or because your solution is most affordable in the world. They will only consider your offering if it helps them <b>grow</b>. The term coined in this booked for designing product around customer’s value proposition is <b>Value Creation Sales</b> (VCS).</div><div><br></div><div>The VCS selling approach is not just limited to sales department. It’s an enterprise wide approach which should be embedded in companies’ culture. Before company defines its offering, they should ask if this solution will be answer to customer’s growth requirement and other functional areas.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>To be able to answer this, you must know your customer’s business well. The methodology called VAP (Value Account Plan) is a systematic approach to understand customer’s business and define the value proposition accordingly. The VAP becomes a resource to customize your solution for best fit of customers needs and prepare your pitch around it. VAP is a comprehensive process which requires training session to sales people and continuous monitoring by senior management to ensure sustainability.</div><div><br></div><div>The question related to customer’s growth cannot be answered, unless you take into consideration your <b>customer’s customer</b> as well. Just like your offering is designed around customers needs, your customers also strive to satisfy their customers. To be able to solve your customer's requirement, learning about your customer's customer becomes inevitable. For instance, ERPNext is not a just a  solution for company to manage their sales, inventory, accounting needs. It’s a tool for an SME to serve their customers better. To address this, we have Website module using which our customers can list their products and create digital footprint on World Wide Web. Also, tracing leads effectively is very important for growing business. ERPNext provide features like auto creation of Lead and Support Tickets and enable them to responds to customer / prospect faster than ever.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s not just about customer’s customer. VCS approach also demands company to consider <b>customer’s competitor</b>. Competitor is the party your customer is concerned most, after their customer. What is their approach in product design? How they answer scalability needs? How do they discover cutting edge technology? Your pitch must also cover feature to convince customer that your offering is not just for answering operations related activities. It will help them stay ahead of competition.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This new customer centric sales approach brings back fun into sales which lost its charm due traditional sales approach like cold pitching and price war. Selling is about sales people communicating their learning from customers to product development team. Selling is like a chain reaction. If ultimate consumer is satisfied, all the parties in chain realize its returns.</div>","2013-07-01",1,"Book Reviews"

<p>Yes you got that right, 2005. <em>Blink</em> and its 2012 - I have been working on this project for atleast 7 years. Wow. When I started, I never thought it would take so long.</p>
<p>It reminded me of the joining letter about <strong>work</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>life's work</strong>, given to Apple recruits and I think this pretty much sums up my life's work for the last decade.</p>
<p><img src=""https://erpnext.com/files/applenewhires.jpg"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>So by that measure, is this something I should be proud of?</p>
<p>Yesterday I also went through <a href=""http://startupschool.org/2012/livingston/"" target=""_blank"">Jessica Livingstone's talk at Startup School</a> on why startups fail. When she listed all the ""monsters"" that startups commonly encounter that causes them to fail. And guess what, I have encountered them all.</p>
<ol>
<li>Rejection (check)</li>
<li>Co-founder dispute (check)</li>
<li>Variety of Problems (check)</li>
<li>Getting Investment (check)</li>
<li>Distractions (check)</li>
<li>Sales calls with large companies (check)</li>
<li>Doing something people do not want (check)</li>
<li>Wrong Hiring (check)</li>
<li>Roller coaster (check)</li>
</ol>
<p>Right now, I am not sure which one was the biggest monster. Co-founder dispute was emotionally draining. Not finding the right market, crushing. Hiring the wrong people, deadly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somehow, maybe through resilience or the lack of a better option I am still on it. Bruised and battered but still standing.&nbsp;Seven years is a long time and when I started off, I honestly thought it was going to be much easier. And the road ahead does not seem to be too easy either.</p>
<p>On the plus side, if this is my life's work, I think it is also something I can be proud of.</p>
<p>I am reasonably happy with where the product is today. ERPNext is now being used by more than 100 small businesses world wide and is fast attracting both a user and developer community around it. ERPs are usually built by large teams and cost a lot of money. We built something with a small team and can still afford to price it cheap. Money has not been good, but if we get reasonable renewals, we should be profitable next year.</p>
<p>When I look around me, I see my friends who are working for large companies or in their family businesses and they seem to be doing great with all the momentum in life. But I don't know how many can show something they have built for the last seven years that represents their life's work.</p>
<p>When we are young, each year means so much because it represents a significant percent of our life. Things happen quickly and time goes slowly. When you cross 30, years seem to suddenly fly by. Blink and a year is over. Did this happen three months ago or a year ago? Is that all we achieved in the past year?</p>
<p>As we move into a post-industrial and post-materialist era, where numbers don't matter and stuff is evil, is there a more humane way to measure your work? How do you reconcile this with the rest of the material world? Right now, I am confused and going through a ""phase"". Maybe I am judging too much and experiencing too little and need to relax a bit. Or maybe its just Friday evening.</p>
<p>Have you worked on one project for seven years? Would love to know how it feels.</p>

We are constantly exposed to bill boards, posters, shop facades, bann","<p class=""p1"">Most of us are oblivious to the role played by marketing in our lives. We are constantly exposed to bill boards, posters, shop facades, banners, television ads, print ads, internet ads, mailers, calls, surveys and we accept it as a way of life. Marketing professionals are finding more and more ways of registering their product in our minds with our passive acknowledgement or in more subtle ways, without our knowledge.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The first role of marketing is to hit our emotions, our animal instincts, by appealing to our senses. Whether it is the red colour of a Cola or the glamorous models of swiss watches, it is all designed with deep sensual appeal. Whether you end of drinking the cola (unwanted carbs) or buying a watch (which is pretty useless too these days considering you are already carrying a mobile phone) is immaterial. The imagery has created an association in your mind that you will not forget easily.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The first time I became aware of this force was by reading the book ""No Logo"" by Naomi Klien. Klien passionately argues how branding has destroyed everything from counter culture (Levi's) to your vision of a good time (Absolut Vodka). Branding today is all pervasive, even schools are no longer sacred. I was recently shocked to see big Nike banners all over my school building.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And don't think this does not work. You will subconsciously tend to believe any thing that is pounded to your brain consistently over a period of time. You are rebellious if you wear a Levi's or you are classy if you were a metallic watch. And what really drives this reckless behaviour by companies is their ambition to become big and powerful.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Coming back to ERPNext, I am often accused of not being ""aggressive"" enough. To be honest, we did try all of that a few years back, when things where a big mess, but these days I am positive that we will never do aggressive branding or marketing. I think it is extremely unkind to the customer to be constantly subjected to an emotional message.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Startups all over are extremely aggressive. Tons of money is spent on making you click the big Sign-up button. Profile targeting is increasingly common and websites are getting more and more annoying with irritating popups.</p>
<p class=""p1"">To me all this is extremely short sighted thinking. Many startups claim to have so many thousands (or millions) users. But how many of those users are deeply engaged with the product? How many have sign-ed up without an idea of what the product is about? How many are on the mailing list because they got sucked by some emotional ""hack""? (The most common hack is, so many thousands have signed up, aren't you getting left behind? And its free to sign-up ... )</p>
<p class=""p1"">What we, at ERPNext, will always focus on is how likely are our customers to recommend our product. Good old word-of-mouth marketing. This means that making sure our current customers remain extremely satisfied and they make personal recommendations in their circles.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1"">Would'nt the world be a kinder place if most companies followed that? Imagine a world without bill boards, pesky callers, garish shop displays, people constantly trying to get under your skin? Do you already feel more peaceful? You might be actually able to enjoy a bit of nature and culture when you walk / drive on the street.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Marketing, the way it is practiced in our times, is nothing but emotional pollution. Think about this the next time you are about to market your product.</p>","2013-02-08",1,"Management"

"","multi-lingual-erpnext","Multi-lingual ERPNext","rushabh","","<p>30% of all features requests for ERPNext are about making it multi-lingual.
So, as we started building the new version, we decided to give it a try.
Conceptually it is very simple, </p>

<p><em>For every text message that is printed
on the screen, there must be a translation dictionary that will be used to
replace the word with the appropriate word in the user's language.</em></p>

<p>But in implementation there are many issues.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Source of messages is varies:</strong> In ERPNext, messages can come from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Database (<strong>DocTypes</strong>, labels, descriptions etc)</li>
<li>Code (Error messages etc)</li>
<li>Client-side Code</li>
<li>Framework Code</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Translations must be partitioned:</strong> There are more than 2000 messages.
So, to club them all is a bad idea because, at a given time, you only
need to work on a subset of it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Loading Translations:</strong> There must a system to load the parts of 
dictionaries on demand, on both, the server-side and the client-side.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Gettext</h3>

<p><code>gettext</code> is the unix standard way of doing multi-lingual
apps. I checked out implementations in Django (a Python web framework)
and OpenERP (a Python ERP). Gettext seemed to have solved the problem
of extracting messages from code by declaring a standard way of writing
messages using the <code>gettext</code> method.</p>

<p>The problem with gettext was that it was a tedious system and its 
translation files were very verbose (high noise to signal ratio). 
Plus it did not solve our problem
of extracting messages from the database and a way to port into the
browser as and when needed.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>

<p>Once I understood how the <code>gettext</code> system worked, I decide to make my
own translation interface. (<em>I know what you are thinking</em>). The webnotes
system will have declarations similar to gettext, but it will have its own
extraction and loading system. Since we have our own framework, we can
<em>automagically</em> (thanks Ryan for this term) attach parts of the translations
when <strong>DocTypes</strong> are loaded. (example: <strong>Sales Order</strong>)</p>

<p>Partitioning was already solved because we had a folder for each <strong>DocType</strong>
and <strong>Page</strong> and that would be the right place to put the transaction dictionary
too.</p>

<p>We can also smartly attach messages for framework as and when needed (like
when a request starts) etc.</p>

<p>So the idea was to use <code>gettext</code> as a starting point and then build a similar
system. Also, few months back when I was working on a new framework prototype,
I had implemented something like this. So parts of the code were also ready!</p>

<h3>Heavy Lifting</h3>

<p>Now that we found a way to extract, partition and load messages, there must be a
way to automatically make translation files for any language. Who is going
to translate 2000 messages in 2012? <em>Google!</em>. So we wired in Google
Translate API to do the heavy lifting.</p>

<h3>Result</h3>

<p>So we wired up this system and it worked!</p>

<p>We ran a Hindi translation and here are the results. <em>Click on the

<p>I was dying to get a post like 'Software Developer' or 'Website Developer'.&nbsp;I was a fresh out from college and was searching for a job. Ever after having good skills and talent I was rejected from many companies.</p>
<p>Many of the companies selected me but were providing me the designation which was not acceptable by me and some demanded ""Security Deposit"",""Contract/Bond"" &amp; ""Original Certifications"" which all are illegal in India. Such activity made me angry and my dignity forced me to reject them. Someone should tell them that 'Hey buddies grow up'.&nbsp;I would suggest every fresher to beware of all such rules and fight against those people who make such dirty deals, instead of joining and supporting them.</p>
<p>First day of my dream job was awesome and I never thought that an office can have such steady environment. It was cool, relaxing, quiet and most importantly there were ""NO RESTRICTIONS"". Web Notes really have a good and highly skilled team and I appreciate their knowledge. I am a well known geek in my town and I had never met any person who could compete with my skills till I joined the company.</p>
<p>It seems like I've got very tough competitors. It will boost my confidence and will make my hidden skills to come out. This will help in company's progress as well as mine.</p>

<p>1. Joining Development Team ASAP.</p>
<p>2. To come under ""About Us"" page in company's website which i refer as ""HALL OF FAME.""</p>

She arranged for a projector at her end so that the entire team could participate.</p>
<p>We started the session at 11 o'clock and ended on 1 o'clock. I used Hindi and English to give traning. In first hour, I gave them training on Selling Module (CRM) where I showed them how to create and manage documents like Lead, Opportunity, Quotation, Sales Order in ERPNext. Also, showed them how to create Masters and uses of various reports and tools. I showed them one complete cycle of transaction in ERPNext. For the same I created one Lead, one Opportunity, one Quotation and one Sales Order.</p>
<p>In second hour, I gave training to their Accounting staff. I started with Sales Invoice then I showed them how to make documents like Journal Voucher, Sales Invoice and Purchase Invoice. We completed one full accounts cycle by creating and submitting one Sales Invoice from an existing Sales Order, and made a payment entry against it.</p>
<p>During the session they asked me many questions regarding product. I answered their questions and they were satisfied by my answers. They enjoyed the session and gave good feedback.

"","my-introduction-to-accounting-[part-1]","My Introduction To Accounting [Part 1]","nabin","","<p>It was the year 2008, I had completed almost one year at Web Notes. At that time, we did not have a product and provided development services as per customer's requirements. We were working on a customized ERP for ""Janak Healthcare"", which gave me an opportunity to get familiar with accounting concepts.</p><p>I completed my engineering in IT, did not have any kind of accounting background. The concepts of Debit/Credit was just like another world to me, my brain cells used to go to sleep mode hearing those terms. Rushabh, was the person, from whom I learned the basics of Accounting. In this blog, I will try to share my very first session.</p><h4>Chart of Accounts</h4><p>Chart of Accounts represents a tree like representation of all accounting heads, used to represent company's financial information. There are two types of accounts: Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Statement accounts. Balance Sheet consists of Assets and Liabilities accounts and Profit and Loss Statement accounts consists of Incomes and Expenses.</p><ul><li>Assets: Bank and Cash balances, outstanding amounts of customers and all other assets are recorded here.</li><li>Liabilities: All the company's liabilities like shareholder's capital, outstanding amount to be paid to suppliers, taxes to be paid to concerned to authorities are recorded under this group.</li><li>Incomes: Income from direct/indirect sales.</li><li>Expenses: All the expenses to run the business, like salaries, purchases, rent etc. are recorded here.</li></ul><h4>Debit and Credit</h4><p>Each of these accounts are either ""Debit"" or ""Credit"" type. Assets, Expenses are ""Debit"" accounts and Liabilities, Incomes are ""Credit"" accounts.</p><p>But I could not understand how will I determine account type? There are many reasons available on books and internet. Then Rushabh told me ""Don't try to understand the logic, simply remember account types for those 4 accounts"".</p><h4>Accounting Entries</h4><p>The balance of account can be increased / decreased, depending on account type and transaction type.</p><table style=""width: 449px; height: 104px;"" border=""1px solid black"" data-mce-style=""width: 449px; height: 104px;""><thead><tr><td style=""text-align: center;"" data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"">Account Type</td><td style=""text-align: center;"" data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"">Transaction Type</td><td style=""text-align: center;"" data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"">Effect on account balance</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;"" data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"">Debit</td><td style=""text-align: center;"" data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"">Debit</td><td style=""text-align: center;"" data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"">Increases</td></tr><tr><td style=""text-align: center;"" data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"">Debit</td><td style=""text-align: center;"" data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"">Credit</td><td style=""text-align: center;"" data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"">Decreases</td></tr><tr><td style=""text-align: center;"" data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"">Credit</td><td style=""text-align: center;"" data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"">Credit</td><td style=""text-align: center;"" data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"">Increases</td></tr><tr><td style=""text-align: center;"" data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"">Credit</td><td style=""text-align: center;"" data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"">Debit</td><td style=""text-align: center;"" data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"">Decreases</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 data-mce-style=""text-align: left;"" style=""text-align: left;"">Double Entry</h4><p style=""text-align: left;"">This means that every accounting entry has two parts, one debit and one credit and must affect two separate accounts.

"","my-introduction-to-accounting-[part-2]","My Introduction To Accounting [Part 2]","nabin","","<p>In part two, I will share our most popular example, which we generally use at the time of training. There was a Chai-wala (Tea Stall) in front of our previous office building. We prefered to go there everyday for tea, in stead of tea delivered in the office. It gave us a nice short break from office environment and an opportunity for different kind of discussions.</p>
<p>We will take that ""Tea Stall"" as a company and see how to book accounting entries for the business.</p>
<p>1. Mama (We used to call Tea Stall Owner by this name) invests Rs 25000 to start the business.</p>
<p><img src=""files/Screen%20Shot%2020130213%20at%2012.12.54%20PM.png"" height=""143"" width=""422"" /></p>
<p>Analysis: Mama invested 25000 in company, hoping to get some profit. In other words, company is liable to pay 25000 to Mama in the future. So, account ""Mama"" is an liability account and it is credited. Company's cash balance will be increased due to the investment, ""Cash"" is an asset to the company and it will debited.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. The company needs equipments (Stove, teapot, cups etc) and raw materials (tea, sugar, milk etc) immediately. He decides to buy from the nearest general store ""Super Bazaar"" who is a friend so that he gets some credit. Equipments cost him 2800 and raw materials worth of 2200. He pays 2000 out of total cost 5000.</p>
<p><img src=""files/Screen%20Shot%2020130213%20at%2012.16.17%20PM.png"" height=""144"" width=""426"" /></p>
<p>Analysis: Equipments are ""Fixed Assets"" (because they have a long life) of the company and raw materials ""Current Assets"" (since they are used for day-to-day business), of the company. So, ""Equipments"" and ""Stock in Hand"" accounts have been debited to increase the value. He pays 2000, so ""Cash"" account will be reduced by that amount, hence credited and he is liable to pay 3000 to ""Super Bazaar"" later, so Super Bazaar will be credited by 3000.</p>
<p>3. Mama (who takes care of all entries) decides to book sales at the end of the every day, so that he can analyze daily sales. At the end of the very first day, the tea stall sells 325 cups of tea, which gives net sales of Rs. 1575. The owner happily books his first day sales.</p>
<p><img src=""files/Screen%20Shot%2020130213%20at%2012.17.55%20PM.png"" height=""285"" width=""421"" /></p>
<p>Analysis: Income has been booked in ""Sales of Tea"" account which has been credited to increase the value and the same amount will be debited to ""Cash"" account. Lets say, to make 325 cups of tea, it costs Rs. 800, so ""Stock in Hand"" will be reduced (Cr) by 800 and expnese will be booked in ""Cost of goods sold"" account by same amount.</p>
<p>4. At the end of the month, the company paid the rent amount of stall (5000) and salary of one employee (8000), who joined from the very first day.</p>
<p><img src=""files/Screen%20Shot%2020130213%20at%2012.18.41%20PM.png"" height=""291"" width=""419"" /></p>
<h4>Booking Profit</h4>
<p>As month progress, company purchased more raw materials for the business. After a month he books profit to balance the ""Balance Sheet"" and ""Profit and Loss Statements"" statements. Profit belongs to Mama and not the company hence its a liability for the company (it has to pay it to Mama). When the Balance Sheet is not <em>balanced</em>&nbsp;i.e. Debit is not equal to Credit, the profit has not yet been booked. To book profit, the following entry has to be made:</p>
<p><img src=""files/Screen%20Shot%2020130213%20at%2012.19.02%20PM.png"" height=""327"" width=""426"" /></p>
<p>Explanation: Company's net sales and expenses are 40000 and 20000 respectively. So, company made a profit of 20000. To make the profit booking entry, ""Profit or Loss"" account has been debited and ""Capital Account"" has been credited. Company's net cash balance is 44000 and there is some raw materials available worth 1000 rupees.</p>

in earnest. We plan to share more and more of how the new version is 
shaping up via our blogs.</p>

<p>This version is going to be a radical re-write and it is coming out
quite good as per our expectation. I think the quality of code
is a couple of notches higher and yes there are test-cases. There are some
major UI updates too. We have used a lot more standard JS libraries
and also shrunk our full framework code from almost 370kb to 230kb.</p>

<p>Some exciting updates to the data structures and forms as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>Customer and Supplier will now be <strong>Party</strong></li>
<li>Merging of transactions (All stock transactions will be
Stock Entry)</li>
<li>No more save-submit-cancel-amend (yes!!)</li>

<ol>
    <li>We finally got our act together and settled down into a steady path in terms of our pricing and platform. Till now we were shooting too much in the dark, now we have more clarity of where we are going.</li>
    <li>We made reasonable progress in new features, usability and quality.</li>
    <li>Analytics was a big game changer in terms of using the ERP data. Now users could get a lot more insight into what was really happening.</li>
    <li>We have seen a steady growth in website traffic and general interest in ERPNext.</li>
    <li>Also have been steadily adding new customers every month.</li>
</ol>

<h4>The lows of 2012 were:</h4>

<ol>
    <li>We are still not profitable.</li>
    <li>Also our attempt to create a partner network came pretty much to nothing. When we see that other products like OpenERP have a huge partner network, it seemed that small IT service providers could be interested in other Open Source ERPs too, but thats
        not the reality. Will write a new blog post on that.</li>
    <li>We have still not fully gotten a handle on how to minimize downtime / issues during releases.</li>
    <li>For the most part of the year, we were unable to make any new releases. It was only in the last couple of months that we finally got the knack of doing small be regular releases.</li>
</ol>

The new ERPNext release was received with appreciation for most part. For this release we decided to go with a gradual release process. We knew it was a big release and there would
be issues we had not thought about. We released to a small batch of customers at a time so that we could gracefully handle support. The release was handled almost single handedly by Anand who did a great job under pressure!&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>On another note, we also had our lowest conversion of new accounts in quite some months. This could be a random event or a combination of factors. The number of emails on our open source forums and GitHub have increased a lot so maybe Open Source is cannibalizing our hosting services? Or are customers waiting for the new release? Or is some competitor taking away too much business? We don't know for sure but we hope its a temporary phenomenon.

"","open-day-october-2012","Open Day October 2012","rushabh","","<p>It is confirmed beyond doubt that I too have a chronic delusionary 
problem all software managers have. Its called over-commitment, or 
huge under-estimation of the unknown risks involved in the process by 
which software is created. In the world of software it seems a common 
problem though. Apple released its new iPhone 5 with a buggy maps 
application. Microsoft released a half-baked Windows 8 and Surface. 
I am sure whey they started planning for these projects they thought 
they would be able to finish well within time.</p>

<p>My usual rule of thumb is to double my estimate how long its going to 
take to build a feature. But double, it seems, is too less.</p>

<p>I think the problem with software planning is similar to how humans 
perceive complexity. If a system has a large number of moving parts 
all interconnected to each other, it is extremely hard to understand 
the network effects of each change you make to the system. Every change, 
however trivial it is, has a potential to propagate in an inter-connected 
system in surprising ways.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare a software experience to a narrative, since 
both involve expressing ideas through words. A software system is series 
of instructions that runs into a length of a typical novel. The difference 
is that a novel is designed to be read from start to finish, but software 
instructions can be read from any point. Moreover, while a novel is static, 
a software embeds ""inputs"" from the user and often simultaneously from a 
set of users, each possibly entering conflicting inputs. Each of these 
inputs changes the narrative. Some of these inputs have minimal impact 
(like a comment) but some inputs can run deep, (like changing the ""state"" 
of an ""object"").</p>

<p>It is mind-boggling to design such a system not to fail. There are only 
three ways to be sure: test it, test it and test it more. This problem 
arises because software writers, like all humans, think linearly (in time) 
and are unsuited to design narratives that have multiple connections. 
Therefore there remains no alternative but to test each time a part of 
the system breaks. And after each fix, the extensive testing has to be 
done again.</p>

<p><em>In short: Testing (and post test / development changes) are much bigger 
than the change itself. Unknown issues will take at least 2-3 times 
the time / effort, and sometimes a lot more, compared to known issues.</em></p>

<p>That’s is our this month’s story. We started with something that seemed 
medium complexity; to automatically post stock in hand when material is 
received from a supplier and book Cost of Goods Sold on shipment to the 
customer. As soon as we started, the network effects kicked in. Some poor 
code we write in the tax calculation did not allow us to update the correct 
valuation automatically and we just got sucked into the quicksand from there. 
This is explain in Anand’s presentation.</p>

"","open-day-september-2012","Open Day September 2012","rushabh","","<p>This was a different month. Not only did we have our best ever month in terms
of new customers (<em>thanks!</em>), but we also had a very different
development experience.</p>

<h4>Going Agile</h4>

<p>Software development falls somewhere between producing art
or a team sport. Art is usually individual. The artist has a unique understanding
of the world and tries to express that uniqueness via the art, whether its a
book, essay, painting, song or a monument. If the artist is able to ""connect"" that
piece with another person using some common experiences, and at the same time
showing something unique, that art is appreciated.</p>

<p>Team efforts on the other hand require co-ordination of a number of different
individuals to produce the experience. Movie making is one such effort. The
director's or writer's vision is brought to life by actors and technicians
each contributing in his or her own way into the product.</p>

<p>This month we learnt that there is something about software that makes it
more like a team effort. The big release of last month was the <a href=""http://erpnext.com/erpnext-analytics.html"">Analytics
tools</a>. We did not specially plan 
for this. For the development of this module, for the first time all three of 
us sat at the same workstation. One of us wrote the code, while the other 
two either watched or planned the next move.</p>

<p>This is a fairly common practice in software development and comes under the
broad umbrella of ""Agile Development"". In practice, it is really difficult
to match the wavelenghts of different individuals, each with a common understanding
and a unique insight to work on a problem at the same time. But this time it
happened for us, and it was really great.</p>

<h4>Other Releases:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Newsletter: You can now send a newsletter to your Leads / Contacts directly
(aplology: I majorly screwed up, sending 10 emails to a lot of people.. sorry!).</li>
<li>Bulk Import of Journal Vouchers (see Accounts module).</li>
<li>UI Updates.</li>
<li>Cleaned up ""Messages"".</li>
<li>New Query Report Builder (no new reports yet but expect all old
reports to be migrated this month!).</li>
</ol>

<h4>Whats cooking?</h4>

<p>This month we plan to take up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Long pending updates to HR and Production modules.</li>
<li>Accounts + Inventory Integration (Cost of Goods Sold).</li>
<li>Item Variant Generator.</li>
<li>New Reports.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Whats happening with the new version?</h4>

<p>Last month we had announed that <a href=""http://erpnext.com/multi-lingual-erpnext.html"">we are 100% on the new version</a> 
(3) of ERPNext. But this month we stopped development on version 3. That's right.</p>

<p>So what happens to all the work? What about multi-lingual?</p>

<p>Don't worry, we will be migrating most of the new features we developed
in the current version. We had to do this because we are a really small
team and the product does need a lot of updates. Hence we cannot afford a 
lot of months without updates. In the end, the new version became
a good testing groud for evaluating new ideas.</p>

"","open-source-and-profitability","Open Source and Profitability","anand","Open Source and Profitability seem contradicting on first thought. Actually they are not.","<p>Open Source, affordablility and profit seemed like conflicting ideas for a business when I first started working on ERPNext. I was fresh out of a large software corporation and was unknown to the way startups thrived. Gradually, I repudiated this view. By next year my apprehensions will be proved wrong. I can recall a discussion we were having last May about this when we were planning to shift our business model. We had a bad year commercially and were thinking of what to do next.</p>
<h4>Business Models</h4>
<p>Most of the profitable, open source products involved something proprietory - dual licensing, properietory extensions or support of complementary proprietory products. That did not seem right though and felt like users were being mis-lead into something that claimed to be open but was not. Non-profits were in a different league. However, Red Hat and WordPress stood out. Red Hat sells support subscriptions for open source Red Hat Enterprise Linux, while WordPress offers hosting (WordPress.com) of their open source product (WordPress.org).</p>
<h4>Annual Plans</h4>
<p>Combining the two, we changed our pricing plans from $7/user/month to yearly hosting plans ($99, $299, $599) and a commercial support plan ($599) at the onset of May 2012. &nbsp;We realized that the per user per month plan was too complicated for the user and for us. Investing in an ERP is an all out effort for a small business, one requiring a champion to push through the initial setup. Once the users start using the system, the company is unlikely to shift to another product for a year. A yearly plan removed much of the complexity and effort of managing subscriptions, provided us with upfront revenue and the commitment motivated the user to complete the implementation - a win-win situation for all parties involved.</p>
<h4>Turn Around</h4>
<p>We were apprehensive what our existing customers would think. But we need not have worried. More than 90% of our customers agreed on the annual plans and it was invigorating. We fixed a lot of bugs, rewrote many parts of the legacy code, released an installer, improved on the website feature, perked up the user interface, architectured a new reporting engine, added internationalization and are closing in on two of the most awaited features - Auto Inventory Integration and Customer/Vendor Logins.</p>
<p>Our forums thrived and were inundated with feature requests. We also recevied a surprising number of developmental queries. A few developers appreciated our responses and donated us for our efforts. It is an amazing feeling to get something when you expect nothing more than thanks. It opened our eyes to the benevolent side of the open source community. We felt honoured.</p>
<h4>Way Forward</h4>
<p>We wish we had more donations. It would highlight our efforts which a “Like” or “+1” never could. We could display the total amount donated to us in a financial year. However, even an entity as well known as the Wikimedia Foundation needs to have fund raisers to survive another year. Why do so few donate on their own volition? I cannot think of an answer. I am no different.</p>
<p>The rational side wants more paying customers and the irrational side, more open source users and survival on donations. Not so practical when the company isn’t profitable yet. Maybe donations can be incorporated into the model. Something like Kickstarter, where users contribute for the features they will benefit from.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ideas now and the year has been pivotal for us. We realize that Open Source can not only be a good thing for the community as a whole but also for business. It helps us creating a brand and attracts followers in a way commercial software never can. Open Source and Profitability no longer seem like enemies but like long lost brothers who are destined to meet one day.</p>","2013-03-25",1,"Open Source"
"","open-source-in-india","Open Source in India","rushabh","India is not particularly known for its Open Source community. In a recent lecture that I attended, one of the luminiaries noted that if you","<p><em>Almost a year ago, I wrote a guest post on the <a href=""http://www.pluggd.in/open-source-erp-software-erpnext-297/"">benefits of Open Sourcing your app</a>. Though I cannot recall my motivation for writing this, the editors at Pluggd.in manged to get a nice headline out of it. Recently a reader of this blog, egged me on to write more on Open Source. In the last few months, I have been observing the Open Source community (mostly home-grown projects) in India trying to see if there is an opening somewhere for us to fit in. Here are my views:</em></p>
<p>India is not particularly known for its Open Source community. In a recent lecture that I attended, one of the luminiaries noted that if you take country-wise rankings of consumption (download) and contributions to Open Source, India comes very low on both those lists.</p>
<h4>Projects</h4>
<p>There are a couple of projects that keep appearing at all places (apart from ERPNext). One is a web based accounting app called <a href=""http://gnukhata.org/"">GNU Khata</a> (""khata"" is ""Account"" in Hindi). I have tremendous respect for its author, Krishnakant Mane, who is a great role model for the visually impaired, but the project itself seems to be in a bad shape and does not seem to go anywhere.</p>
<p>The other Open Source app in India is <a href=""http://projectfedena.org/"">Fedena</a>, an Open Source school ERP. The company behind it seems to have a knack for marketing and PR and the design looks nice too. But if you give the app a spin, you will realize that its a pretty basic app and would make anyone instantly suspicious of their claims that it is used in 40,000 schools. The app, no doubt, has good potential, but the company, in my view, takes a big dent in its credibility due to their claims. <em>Can Fedena have more users (20 million) than Basecamp (7 million)?</em></p>
<h4>Events</h4>
<p>There are very few Open Source events in India, big or small. I attended the recent Ubuntu lanuch event in one of the local elite universities (IIT Bombay) and it did not seem to be a great place for discussions. None of the ""bright"" IIT students asked a single question to <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/1839297/how-failed-aakash-tablet-object-lesson-indias-long-road-ahead-tech-innovation"">Prof Phatak, who had just started heading the Indian government's low-cost tablet project</a>. And when I asked, I got admonished by one student after the lecture in a near threatening tone, <em>how did I even dare</em>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of flagship events, <a href=""http://osidays.com"">Open Source India Days</a> and <a href=""http://foss.in/"">FOSS.IN</a>. Incidently both are happening at the same venue in Bengaluru and that too one after the other. A quick glance tells me that OSI Days is are targetted to the large software service companies of India and an opportunity for the large enterprise vendors to show their stuff or sell services. <em><br /></em></p>
<p>FOSS.IN on the other end seems to be a conference with a more international speakers and focussing on large FOSS projects. Focus seems more evangelizing and networking. Also did not find any home grown Open Source project disucssed here.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Online Communities</h4>
<p>Some of the Open Source groups like the <a href=""http://www.linux-india.org/"">Linux User Group</a> and Python group are pretty harmless too. They are mostly hunting grounds for recruiters and people wanting to practice their public speaking skills or newbies who are too lazy to read manuals or use Google to find solutions.</p>
<h4>Individual Contributors</h4>
<p>If there are individual contributors to popular open source projects, and I am pretty sure there have to be a handful, I have not personally come across them. I think they might be more active in global online communities rather than Indian ones.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href=""http://fci.wikia.com/wiki/Contributors"">partial list</a> of Indian FOSS contributors (though the """"developer of the month"" has not been updated since April 2008).</p>
<h4>Companies</h4>
<p>Apart from RedHat India and the tons of small Elance job shops who can install / setup any Open Source software out there (OpenERP, Magento, Wordpress etc) for under $100, there are not many Open Source Companies in India.</p>
<p>One exception is <a href=""http://www.gluster.org/"">Gluster</a>. Gluster is a remote backup system that is now a part of RedHat. It says it is headquartered in the US, but I am sure a lot of the development took place in India. So that makes it a welcome anamoly.</p>
<h4>Ecosystem</h4>
<p>The United States, from where practically 90% of all Open Source software comes, has a great Open Source eco-system comprising of spunky small companies like Automattic and 37Signals, large Corporations like RedHat, IBM, Sun (now owned by <em>he who must not be named</em>) and universities contributing to Open Source.</p>
<p>So what does India have? (<em>No, mother (maa) will not be helpful</em>)</p>
<p>Higher education in India is completely dysfunctional, yes including the famed IITs. Since it is common knowledge, so I won't dwell on this. The large enterprises too have yet to exhibit any kind of innovative energy that would lead to more contributions to Open Source. In other words, if they are not pushed by some crisis to become more innovative, they will soon be dinasours.</p>
<p>A few years back, I was invited to be a part of an elite group formed by the most blue chip Indian Software Vendor and the local IIT to explore the Open Source ERP space. Though I was a misfit in this group belonging to these elite institutions (I know I am done with my quota of the word ""elite"") it was clear in a couple of meetings that this was going to be only a theoritical and back-rubbing exercise.</p>
<p>There are very very few startups in India that publish ""anything"" as Open Source. Among the noteworthy exceptions are a small media and event company, <a href=""http://hasgeek.com/"">HasGeek</a> who have open sourced their pretty job board.</p>
<h4>Where Does ERPNext Fit?</h4>
<p>Initially we started with Open Source since most of the web frameworks (Rails, Django, Zope etc) were Open Source. So Open Source was the default option. When we started to build ERPNext, it just made sense to take that forward. There were a dozens of ERPs in the market and I thought atleast we could stand out. There was lesser competition in Open Source (the famous ones were, and still are, Compiere, OpenERP and OpenBravo).</p>
<p>So it was not all altruism that got us started. Consequently, Open Source is not something we have based our strategy on. Our focus is on the services we provide (hosting, support, bugfix, backups) based on our product. Commercial support for Open Source is only a small fraction of our overall revenue.</p>
<p>I think we have survived the torrid early days and we are surely maturing. Even though we are in near isolation, all is not lost. Every now and then we get someone who gets genuinely excited about ERPNext. But its a long process and it takes time.</p>
<h4>In Conclusion</h4>
<p>This has turned out to be a longer post than I anticipated, but the writing on the wall is unmistakable. The Indian FOSS movement is in a pause mode and there does not seem to be much energy out there.</p>

"","open-source-work-culture","Open Source Work Culture","rushabh","","<p>This week, I read a few chapters from Daniel Greenberg's 
<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Free-Last-Sudbury-Valley-School/dp/1888947004/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1339576054&amp;sr=8-9"">Free at Last</a>
about the <a href=""http://www.sudval.org"">Sudbury Valley School</a>. The concept
of the Sudbury School is that there are no ""classes"". Childern who
attend the school can do whatever they mighty please when they come
to school. They can play, read, build, make movies, make music etc.
Even basic reading and arithmatic are not taught by compulsion.</p>

<p>Now if a bunch of kids want to learn a topic, they can form a group
and ask a teacher (yeah there are teachers too) to take classes. The author
goes on to explain, that when he teaches arithmatic to a ""class"", they 
ususally complete the entire 6 year textbook in 20 weeks! Yes you got
that right, 6 years in 20 weeks. This is possible because the students
""want"" to learn arithmatic and are not forced to learn.</p>

<p>I was wondering if any of this applies to the work environment. What if
we let people do what they please so that it would unlock their potential
and productivity by a big margin. So we did some brainstorming and here is 
what we came up with.</p>

<p>From now on, there will be no work assignment at Web Notes. That is,
I, will not direct what everyone has to do, everyone can work on
whatever they feel is important and interesting to them. The condition
is that it should add value to the organization. The other condition is
that all customer queries, issues, emails must be replied immediately. Apart
from that, there will be no direction.</p>

<p>Now how do we evaluate and sync everyone then? What plan to do is have a 
<strong>Demo Day</strong> on the last Thursday of every month. On Demo Day, all team 
members will present what they did in the month out of their own initiative.
What features did they make or what documentation they wrote, or
test cases, or a new product, or a new marketing initiative. 
It could be anything that adds value to ERPNext.</p>

<p>All the Demo Day presentations will be made public on this blog
and the best performance (by voting) will get a small cash award of
approx (Rs 5000 / $100).</p>

<p>This also means Open Sourcing our management. So look forward to our 
presentations at the end of the month and follow us to understand how 
this experiment is working out for us.</p>

"","pair-programming-my-personal-experience","Pair Programming - My Personal Experience","nabin","In this article, I will try to share my views about pair programming what I have experienced in last one month","<p><a target=""_blank"" title=""Pair Programming"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming"">Pair programming</a> typically means coding done by two people together on a single machine sitting side by side. When one person writes code, the other person reviews the code continuously, and thinks about the next move. And they generally switch their role after approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours.<br /><br />In this article, I will try to share my views about pair programming what I have experienced in last one month. Here, in <a target=""_blank"" title=""erpnext"" href=""http://www.erpnext.com"">erpnext</a>, we always try to adopt better and innovative ways to work (thanks to Rushabh). Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. This time, we tried ""Pair Programming"". Anand and myself paired for &nbsp;redevelopment of ""Manufacturing Module"" and ""Stock Reconciliation"".<br /><br />At the beginning, there were many questions in my mind:</p>
<p>1. Is it worth to invest two developers' time to finish one developer's job?<br />2. How day-to-day technical support will be managed?<br />3. Pair programming will succeed only if you can make the right pair. Will it work?<br /><br />Keeping those questions in mind, we decided to give it a try. In pair programming, it is always better to have complementary skills. And in our case, Anand has very good technical knowledge and a decent taste in UI design, and on the other hand, I have enough functional knowledge.<br /><br />After finishing our first task (Manufacturing module redesign), we were quite satisfied. We found that the workflow and the forms have been significantly simplified, the code is looking nice and number of bugs have been reduced after release. We took more than expected time to finish the task, but it was due to lack of clarity and scope of projects kept expanding with our progress. So, we decided to do more ground-work and discussions before actual coding from next task.<br /><br />So, in our next task, redesigning of Stock Reconciliation, we started with detailed discussion and writing down all possible cases in white board. After that we started with UI design (which ideally should have been done in the end) and then moved to writing testcases and actual logic. And believe me, this time we enjoyed more because of initial ""White Board Discussion"" and enough clarity in mind.<br /><br />It is always pleasure to work with Anand and I learned a lot during pair-programming. Good coding practices and how to dare to rewrite the existing ugly code. Most of the time, Anand was doing coding, because of my slow typing speed which led me to practicing ten finger typing. I have already increased my speed a bit :)<br /><br />After one month's experience, I think pair programming is always better for difficult and medium sized tasks. It provides better code, fewer bugs, simpler design and better productivity. Two heads really are better than one.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed for our next assignment ""Account Inventory Integration"".</p>","2013-01-26",1,"Development"
"","people-management","People Management","rushabh","Thoughts on team building in a small businesses.","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Recently, a very active ERPNext user mentioned in an email that he was very impressed with the way the ERPNext team was managed and asked me what made it tick.&nbsp; It was an interesting observation, because I don’t think I am very good at it. This observation was also made by someone else whom I know well. So maybe there are some things I do right.</span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">To be honest, I have made every mistake in the book as far as recruitment and people management is concerned. From choosing the wrong people, letting them stay for too long to not giving enough direction and feedback, and not selecting the right people for the right job, I have done it all. To be fair, I don’t think people management is an easy job. All humans are extremely creative, resourceful, complex and independent. The trick is to identify what works for you.&nbsp;</span><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;"">Here are some random experiences and thoughts regarding people management for small businesses.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><b style=""font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.428571429;"">Availability</b><br></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">General advice one gets about selecting people is, select the best, or people who are better than you. In reality, most companies, specially small businesses, cannot attract such talent and even if they do, few can retain them. So given that you cannot start with the best talent, you need to work with what is available.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Our society is heavily biased in favour of large enterprises. Most highly skilled and motivation people want to work for large enterprises because offer stability, large social and work networks, exciting workplaces and smart and ambitious co-workers. Most graduates queue up to join large enterprises simply because they are familiar. So small business have to find people who are skilled in some areas but unskilled in others. For sure, certain people fall through the cracks, but such occasions are very rare. So a founder / owner of a small business, must always be prepared to hire semi skilled people or people who do not meet all expectations.</span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Motivation</b></span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The first thing I want to know about a person is what makes him or her get switched on. How high are they on the ambition scale and if they are low then how do I make them go higher. To understand that I want to know about their backgrounds, what they did in school, what are their likes, dislikes, when do the eyes light up, when do the smiles broaden. To plot their future, its important to know their past.</span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The biggest problem here is that due to availability, most people come from a very flat trajectory. They did okay in school, they were average in their previous job, they have little ambition or hope of going much forward. Maybe they are so out of touch with their inner selves that they never think about it actively. This means that you are probably going to end up spending a bit of time with them, trying to just make them get in touch with their inner ambitions. Sometimes it feels like a futile exercise, but I am not sure if there is any other way.</span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>No Restrictions</b></span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Most companies have elaborate rules and mechanisms of work. For me, its simple, do anything that contributes to the organization. Not only can you get rid of unwanted bureaucracy, but also free up a lot of energy that gets wasted in having useless restrictions, like what time do you come to work. Most of this thinking has been inspired from 37signals but I think it should apply to a lot more organizations than people think.</span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Having a no-restrictions work place is not easy if you have never tried it before. Sometimes it may seem that its not working, but it needs to be given time and has to be complemented by a goal driven culture. Intrinsic motivation takes a much bigger role than external motivation because you have let go of the things that are measurable (like how many hours did you work).</span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Cynicism</b></span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I think the defining mood of my generation is cynicism. As young people entering the workforce in the beginning of the millennium, we feel that we have been let down by all our institutions, beginning from our schools to our governments. We do not embrace our organizations with an open heart and commitment and we are not here to make friends. This is because, we have been cheated so many times before, that we prefer holding back rather than appearing stupid. This cynicism is so deep rooted that it is extremely hard to make people truly commit themselves to a cause.</span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Specially in a creative environment like software development, there is no better way of unlocking creativity than letting people know that its cool to be stupid and its okay to make mistakes. Encouraging mistakes is also a great way to reduce cynicism. Sometimes its very hard to look at a damaging mistake and say its okay, but it helps to look away and let the person accept by themselves they mistake they have made. If they do not realize then it can be pointed out at a later point, when they are a bit removed from the issue.</span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Nature of the Relationship</b></span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One of the few good business books I read was the theoretical “The Modern Firm” by John Roberts. What I remember is that when the relationship between the organization and the employee breaks, the person who leaves the job is a much bigger loser than the organization. Because when the person leaves the job, that person leaves all the social networks, intellectual property and a lot of the skills that person would have learnt will all be rendered useless. The company on the other hand, still gets to keep all the work done by the person including the wealth created or added. An employee creates a lot more capital than what is paid as salary.</span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So its really important to look at the insecurities of the work relationship from an employee point of view and try and address this. The employee must see a long term benefit to the contributions made other than just the salary that is paid. This can be done in many ways, including giving public recognition of the work, involvement in strategic decision making, equity and many other things. What works in our case is also that since we are an Open Source company, a lot of the wealth created by the employee is also a part of the commons.</span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Diversity</b></span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I actively look to hire people from different backgrounds and skills and attitudes. I think diversity makes us a much balanced outfit because we think from so many different perspectives. Not only cultural diversity, every person must also have different behavioral characteristics that are complementary to each other. For example, in our development team, I am the starter (of new projects), Anand is the finisher and Nabin is the maintainer. In this way we use our complementary skill to cover up for each others weaknesses.</span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Closing Thoughts</b></span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In the end, no matter what one does, people management is never going to be a perfect science. Most of the people who have worked at Web Notes have liked it here. Most have been surprised when they were asked to leave, but that is the hard reality of life. Given a choice, I would hire people with much higher skills, internal motivation and strong work ethic and would never have to fire anyone.</span>
</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">At ERPNext, I am personally very happy with what we have achieved as a small team, but for some reasons (or many), I have not been able to change the graphs of many of my team members to a more upward trajectory. Even though everyone gives their best effort, I still want to them to question the definition of “best” effort. This will require even higher commitment to the organization and the cause. How will I get there? I have no idea (yet).</span>

"","pitching-erpnext-to-silicon-valley","Pitching ERPNext to Silicon Valley","rushabh","Pitching ERPNext at Sramana Mitra's 1Mby1M Public Round Table","The dust had not yet settled on the new release, and my thoughts started wandering into what next. I was getting worried that our sales were not where we were expecting. We could not point out any specific reasons though. It could be that
more users where using ERPNext Open Source than ERPNext Cloud, it could be the economy or it could be some changes we made on the website or the product. Whatever the case, it got me thinking on the marketing side.
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>I realised that more people need to know about ERPNext, and started looking for people who had written articles on ERPs and specially in India (though we could have looked globally, but I thought that Indian bloggers or journalists may be a bit more interested
    in our story). Thats when I came across <a href=""http://www.sramanamitra.com/"">Sramana Mitra's blog</a>. I had read Sramana's blog before and I knew she wrote about startups. Maybe I could drop in a mail and see if she would be interested in
    writing about us. I got a reply from her assistant that I should pitch at one of her public roundtables that she hosts online every week.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>So I looked up her site and <a href=""http://www.sramanamitra.com/previous-strategy-roundtables-recordings/"">found recordings from previous round tables</a>. It was very interesting. Here was a resource of hundreds of startup pitches I never had a look
    at. I figured she ran a project called ""1Mby1M"", her ambitious project &nbsp;/ startup to create one million enterprises each valued (or with revenues?) over one million dollars each. Sramana seems to me like a Silicon Valley insider who wants to innovate
    on the startup incubation industry. Well either ways, I thought it would be a good idea to present, there was nothing to lose. So I prepared a presentation outlining what ERPNext was about and what challenges we faced. Even though I do this every month (<a href=""https://erpnext.com/blog?category=Open%20Day"">for our Open Day</a>), it was still interesting to make a pitch for someone from Silicon Valley.
</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div><a href=""http://www.sramanamitra.com/2013/08/22/roundtable-recap-august-22-all-indian-affair/"">The presentation went okay</a>&nbsp;(skip the first 30 or so minutes). There were two things I would take away. One is that she felt that this was a multi-million opportunity that could be bootstrapped (without taking venture funds). That was a great validation. I am sure Sramana has seen hundreds
    of pitches and if thats what she felt, it was awesome. The other point was that she did not like us using the word ""hosting"" for our services. She wanted us to use the word ""cloud"". This has been on my mind sometime too. Couple of years ago, all enterprise
    software companies were screaming cloud from the roof of their buildings and I had never liked the word. But now some water is under the bridge and the hype around cloud has subsided, I think cloud might be a better word to capture our service offerings
    - Cloud Hosting for Open Source ERP. I liked that.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>Sramana also has a <a href=""http://1m1m.sramanamitra.com/"">paid offering for startups</a>. That is her virtual incubator. I think its an awesome concept, for $1000 she offers hours of recorded course material, introduce us to her contacts in Silicon Valley, have private strategy group discussions and will also put in a word for the media. From our perspective, we could surely love to get help in getting the word around, specially in Silicon Valley, where the world's eyes are.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>But as a few days passed, I realised that we are happy being an outsider and we were doing okay. Firstly, our sales same time last year were also low. Maybe June to August is not a good time for ERP sales (maybe its a cyclic industry). Secondly, we still
    had a number of level zero requirements to be finished. Fixing our documentation (now in way earnestly) rewriting our old code (more than 70% complete) and building better infrastructure and improving our conversion rates. Even if we got 1000 trials signed
    up in a hurry, I was not sure we had the infrastructure in place to handle them.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>But in all, it was a great experience, I am thankful to Sramana for her time and feedback. I am sure her program will help a lot of startups get their foundations in place.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>I would surely recommend startups to pitch at her Public Round Table.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>ps. Some feedback for Sramana: I think she needs to redesign her website. It looks very 2000 and there are too many links. These days, too many links on a page makes it feel spammy. Plus the hanging social buttons on the side are very annoying. She needs
    to look at medium.com for inspiration. Also the website has to be more about 1mby1m, her project. By projecting her blog and personality strongly, the program gets ignored. I can automatically think of a much better design. Maybe she should hire Sukh
    Dugal's <a href=""http://www.studiomarch.com/"">StudioMarch</a> (probably India's best web design company, and we have worked with them before) for a redesign! I wish her all the best.</div>","2013-08-30",1,"Startups"
"","problem-or-opportunity","Problem or Opportunity","umair","Learning from the book I read last month.","Book: What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20&nbsp;
<div>Author: Tina Seelig</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>Tina Seelig is an executive director for entrepreneurship center at Stanford University. This book is an amazing write-up for students, entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs who made unsteady transition to adulthood. Writer has very nicely explained concepts of innovation, lateral thinking and dealing with failure with tons of success stories in this book.
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><b>Innovation:</b>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>My first understanding about Innovation was that, its a kind of experimental worked which is only practiced in laboratory. Well, innovation is possible in every aspect of live. Not just professionally, but politically, socially, culturally. Just about everywhere.
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Identifying a scope for Inventions primarily starts with identifying a problem. The assignment is given to Stanford student setup a business, with just $5 provided as seed funding. Each group is given three days time to work on it and present the outcome to class in three minute’s presentation. The most successful groups where the ones who identified the existing problems well and introduced business around it.
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The best case study to understand the innovation at work is introduction of Balloon Angioplasty. Before invention of this therapy, by-pass surgery was the only option to clear the blockages of arteries. The invention of balloon angioplasty, which faced lots of resistance in its early days, has bypassed the most critical stage of by-pass surgery, which is opening the chest of the patient. It has done a great justice with the life of patients. This therapy cured patient without any need of surgery and opened the blockages of arteries and veins just like by-pass surgery did. This was only when doctors were briefed on the idea of innovation at work!
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>It becomes difficult for one to think innovatively when stuck in routine. The way around to think innovatively is lateral thinking. Consider a problem and be open for the most weird and not immediate and non-obvious solution. Sometimes what looks weird to others can be toned down and turned into a great innovative idea by others. Writer explains this with wonderful saying. <i>All the cool stuff happens when you do things that are not the automatic next step.
</i></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><b>Problem Blindness:</b>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>This is when your perspective at the thing doesn't help you identify the problems. This is when you cannot think about an innovative way to make the existing thing better. We at ERPNext are victim to this very problem. While development and support team has seen product evolved with time, it’s just not possible for us to identify the obvious usability issues in it and improve. It because we understand the current features so well and don’t encounter usability issue first hand. It’s only when customer provides feedback that your current workflow is not intuitive.
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>To address this problem, we should look at the existing product or process from customer’s perspective. If your expertise doesn't allow you to look at it from that perspective, hear your users attentively.
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><b>Dealing with Failure:</b>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Being able to deal with failure effectively, that’s what author describes as a secret sauce of Silicon Valley. Steve Jobs states that it was his failure of being removed from Apple. But he capitalized on it by starting companies like Pixar and NeXT. And on return of Steve in Apple, he brought the technologies with him. And it was these technologies, and not the Steve, which gave Apple a new direction.
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Failure is a natural part of the learning process. If you aren't failing sometimes, then you aren't taking enough risk. In business, trying and failing, then again trying and failure and repeating the same till you succeed should be an attitude to excel, at every aspect of your business.
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><b>Be Lucky:</b>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Luck is not something which is served to us on platters. Even if we see spiritually, almighty has gives us capability to take first step. What we need to see is that, as a professional, are we taking that first step or no. Below is the case study (outside the book) on characteristics of lucky people.
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>An expert conducted survey to learn the characteristics of successful and lucky people. In the reception area where all&nbsp;attendees&nbsp;were waiting to be surveyed, he had a note posted on clip board. It said that, if you see this note, you will right away get $500. At the end of survey, analysis suggested that most of the people who were successful and progressive in life had seen that notice. The one’s struggling didn't observe it.
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The author here suggests us to be active at networking, not just virtually. We never know the person next to us in train can help us reach next level. Or maybe we could do the same to him. Every time we move out, there is a million dollars opportunity waiting for us. It’s only about trying till we strike the right chord.
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In a nutshell, this book directs an amateur as well as professional to see things from different perspective. Perspective which can add more value to our lives. Innovation has no standard formula we can gain expertise at. Being innovative is an attitude.
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And as book title right stated, I really wish I knew these concepts when I was 20.
</div>","2013-08-12",1,"Book Reviews"
"","rebooting-2012","Rebooting 2012","rushabh","","<p>We have spent the last few months busy in trimming off things that I can best call as ""pre-mature optimization"". I estimate we would have killed 30% of our entire code base. </p>

<p>The lowest hanging fruit was our billing app. It sucked and there was too much hard-wiring to make it fun to update. What we realized is that for this kind of a product, we could do with annual billing. I know the world is moving towards micro payments and small billing, and it is something we could bring back in the future, but right now, with the resources we have its best this way.</p>

<p>The other major upgrade is the website, this website is built ""on"" erpnext. All the web pages are generated dynamically from ERPNext. This is my first blog from within the app. To add a new blog, all I do is log in to my account and add a new blog entry. So we have managed to fuse two separated codes into one.</p>

<p>There are a lot of changes under the hood too. After a major gardening effort, we managed to rename 40 odd tables into better names, that meant changing all links, and SQL statements and files and what not. We also managed to re-write a whole bunch of Javascript code and also the way we manage form-level customizations. Till now, we had no way to separate customizations done by a user at the form-level so we could never release new form layouts. We have fixed this and we will now have the freedom to optimize our form layouts a lot more.</p>

<p>Also, free trials are back! After taking them out for the better part of the year we are bringing them back. The reason is that since we are no longer offering monthly billing, customers will want to try out before they commit a larger amount. We still have not decided how much support we can provide with the trials.</p>

<p>This release will make our product a lot better engineered with a much tighter code-base. We hope to keep making continuous improvements on the same trend. What we need now is a ton of new customer signups!</p>

"","running-in-circles","Running in Circles","rushabh","","<p>There is one thing all startups to. Follow other startups. Blame Google and
Facebook for this, because the way these companies grew, they have given 
everyone a get-rich-and-famous-quick hope. ""Yaar, tu ek solid app 
kyun nahi banata? (Why don't you make a block-buster 
app?)"", my school friend (who is now a ""businessman"" and hence has a right
to advice me) tells me. I know internally he is worried about why am 
I such a slouch while everyone is already making it big. Though I wonder
who the ""everyone"" is.</p>

<p>To be totally honest, I was swayed by the Google-Facebook exponential 
growth illusion too.</p>

<p>It crept up on me sub-consciously and I started fearing that I will miss the 
next-big-thing. I know, we are not even starting to talk about ability
and we are talking about the next-big-thing. A classic wannabe. 
Not all of it was bad though. I learnt, and am still learning a lot 
of things. On many nights, I found myself visiting startup blogs 
and forums [1], looking for the tiny bit of market information, or the 
latest CSS meme that will give me an edge.</p>

<p>I also followed my direct competitors. I envied the kind of attention and 
community they got. ""Open Source"" in India has roughly the same connotation 
as the word ""beggar"", or if I am in a more generous mood, ""gypsy"".</p>

<p>So what did I gain from this?</p>

<p>Some of it was good startup theory that I should have known. Steve Blank, 
Eric Reis, 37Signals others are great at dispensing this [2]. I have gained 
a lot of insight and inspiration, put my mistakes in perspective, 
identified my focus and aligned my strategy. </p>

<p>But most of the writing about startups is about catching next-big-thing. 
Its a lot about empty bravado by the founders, with a nice helping of
straight lies about traction and growth. Fake it, if you can't make it, 
is not too far from the truth.</p>

<p>If you don't walk away a bit, its easy to forget that great organizations 
are built on excellence. The kind that takes a lot of experience, patience and
dedication to build. ""what-everyone-else-is-doing"" (a.k.a. social media)
is often a distraction that takes you away from excellence. </p>

<p>People also forget that Facebook came out of 
Harvard and Google out of Stanford. Malcolm Gladwell explains in his book,
Outliers, that super-achievers are more likely a product of their
demographics along with ability. (Ability is necessary but not sufficient). 
Stanford and Harvard are at the bleeding edge of innovation and their success is 
not easy to replicate. </p>

<p>Startups reading about other startups is often like children running 
after each other in circles. Sometimes though, its fun.</p>

<p>[1] The mainstream media is mostly clueless about startups. They print any
PR crap that gets them a free lunch/dinner. It is shockingly bad. I have
stopped reading the company news section of any news / business paper.
Mainstream media writes about startups when there is heightened funding
activity or an IPO round the corner. For example, ecommerce is (or was?) 
the flavour of the month in India and Facebook is the flavour of the
month in the west. But not strictly, free lunches are always welcome.</p>

<p>[2] I think Peter Thiel's startup class is pseudo science. 
He is a smart VC at the right time and right place, but not a great 
theorist.</p>

"","saas-vs-self-hosted","SaaS Vs Self-Hosted","umair","","<p>Why do companies prefer local hosting over web hosted software 
applications?  The most heard reason is data security. Yes, we all 
want our data to be located where only we can access it. But will the 
local hosting make my data security absolute?</p>

<p>Let us compare them:</p>

<h3>Self-hosted Application</h3>

<h4>Merits:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Better speed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Demerits:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Hardware infrastructure and maintenance cost.</li>
<li>Need for staff to manage IT infrastructure.</li>
<li>Limited accessibility.</li>
<li>No instant support.</li>
<li>No easy recovery if lost data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hosted (cloud) Application:</h3>

<h4>Merits:</h4>

<ul>
<li>IT infrastructure and services outsourced.</li>
<li>Accessibility over internet.</li>
<li>Smooth product upgrades and support.</li>
<li>Specialized data center services.</li>
<li>Automated backups.</li>
<li>Easy exit option.     <!-- keep these spaces --></li>
</ul>

<h4>Demerits:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Data stored in remote location.</li>
<li>Internet connectivity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Trends</h3>

<p>As per the Gartner groups research, SaaS market is growing every year at the 
rate of 20%. Its current total valuation stands at $12.1 Billion and is expected
to reach $21.3 Billion by 2015.[1]</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>Hosting your data locally and keeping it offline will protect your data 
from online hackers. But it cannot be protected if an insider leaks your data.
Someone can easily backup companies confidential data in flash drive and 
walk away. Self-hosting may not be as secure as you think.</p>

<h3>IT Infrastructure Outsourced</h3>

<p>Every company needs to focus on its core competency which contributes to 
growth, and have the software take care day-to-day operations and other 
repetitive task.</p>

<h3>Product Upgrades</h3>

<p>Upgrades are a lot smoother in web hosted application. The service providers 
can remotely upgrade, monitor and provide support on new feature releases. </p>

<p>Concludingly, if you can trust your expensive and confidential possessions 
with courier company, why not trust software company for your data??  </p>

"","sales-and-silliness-part-i","Sales and Silliness Part I","priya","Do ERPs really help in day to day work or are just an annoyance? A story.","<div>This is the story of a sales employee who refused to systematise her data on an ERP system. Her name was Veena. She was the star sales performer in her organisation. She always delivered her numbers, was extremely hardworking, and loved by everyone in office. Life was beautiful till two major casualties took place. One, she got a new boss. Two, that boss decided to install an ERP.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The new boss was a stickler for systematisation of data. He was obsessed with data management. He had a background in knowledge management and came from a company that managed all their operations on ERP. There was no way you could talk him out of it. Nobody wanted to bell the cat. Eventually, the cat got the mouse, I mean the boss got his ERP.</div><div><br></div><div>This is how the first session with Veena and &nbsp;ERP implementation started. For ease of narration, lets call the boss “B”. B knew that Veena was his key performer, who would finally give him his target sales. It was important to get a buy-in from her. B started with the standard ERP benefits . He claimed that it is a software package that offers convenience of managing all the business functions from a single platform. No need of going to different applications to process different requests. No need of saving data in different functional packages. Under one ERP ""roof"" you can manage Accounting, Warehouse Management, CRM, Human Resources, Supply Chain Management, Sales Management, and Website Design.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Veena thought all that the ERP did was to facilitate B's life. He could keep a watch on all his &nbsp;employees and their doings from his system. She had a straightforward way of talking, didn't mince her words and could never keep her objectionable opinions to herself. She had no patience for jargon and no time to invest in office etiquettes. She said “Boss, whats in it for me? For B, who was generally used to a very pliable workforce, Veena was a challenge. She would not accept his words unless he proved his methods and his systems.</div><div><br></div><div>He pointed out to her that the selling module of ERP allows you to store all the addresses and contact details of your leads and customers. The system can send mails to the contacts, remind you of follow-ups and also keep a record of all transactions and communication that took place with that particular client. Red flags started flying in Veena's mind. She didn't want her leads on an open system, where other sales employees could see it. What if they pursue her leads and complete their targets. Putting up information about leads was out of question! Veena used to also stage manage her targets. She would meet her targets and never exceed them. She would keep the hot prospects to close in the coming month. That way, she always met her numbers. Showing hot leads on the system will give the boss a chance to question why she was not closing them. No way, this ERP was a ticking bomb ready to explode her well set-up office performance and the bonuses that came along. Something had to be done. She argued with B, said she will continue with her old ways, and left for a client call.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>B was aghast with this behavior. He simply couldn't understand how to convince her. Being from operations, he could not understand the sales mind. He looked up to Google. “How to sell ERP to your own employees”. He found a lot of literature and general gyan. But nothing that could convert a stubborn sales mind-set. He decided to focus on his other employees. The Accounts team who used Tally were showing some resistance to shift to ERP and import all their data. He decided he will handle them first, and then get back to Veena.</div><div><br></div><div>Veena in the meanwhile continued with her client meetings and steady account closures. She was as usual on target. She was a young ambitious girl and wished to climb the corporate ladder in the right way. She came early to office and was punctual on all her sales-calls. After meetings, she came back to office, emailed her prospects, did all the paper work, and then went home. She would often sit late and finish her correspondence to her clients. Her colleagues too followed the same pattern. They would often order a sandwich and finish making their sales orders, sales invoice, packing slips, delivery notes etc. She also noted down all pending cheques to be collected, reminders to be sent, and clients to be renewed. All this took a lot of time. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Lately she noticed that most of her sales colleagues were leaving office on time. They did not sit back late and also went for evening dates. She started feeling the pang. How could they manage work and have a life after office? She became restless and discussed with her fellow colleague. &nbsp;Her colleague said, ERP gave them all this time to spare. ERP generated their sales orders automatically, printed sales invoices instantly, made delivery notes, and gave a list of all the cheques that were paid, delayed, and bounced. The system reminded them about their follow-up emails, maintained past transactions, and emailed configured notes on set dates.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Veena started thinking. &nbsp;She would definitely have loved to get more time with her friends, see movies, and take the weekend off. If ERP would give all this, then she was willing to follow the process. She went to B and said she was willing to be a part of the ERP brigade.</div><div><br></div><div>Her struggle with the software and its adaptation is narrated in the next blog, Sales and Silliness- Part II (coming soon).</div><div><br></div>   ","2013-08-09",1,"General"

She resolved to change her lifestyle. She realised that she gets so engrossed in her work, that lately she had begun collecting payments in her dreams. To change the current scenario, Veena accepted the idea of trying out ERP to ease her workload.</div><div><br></div><div>With a stern resolve she opened the ERP manual. The manual said ERP is like Exercise. It is painful in the short run; but, will do wonders in the long run. Exercise! the word sent her in a tizzy. She remembered paying her gym fees and not being able to continue. The ERP manual had touched the wrong chord. She closed the manual.</div><div><br></div><div>The IT department had installed ERP on her system. The user manual stared at her from the table. She had no time to pick it up. She left for her appointments. After finishing her calls she decided to figure out ERP. She failed to understand that setting up an ERP system and feeding data in it was not an after office job. It required dedicated time and focused application. After typing some customer addresses she was tired. It was lot of work. She went home.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Over the couple of days she tried figuring how to upload data in bulk. It was a big pain. The setup was taking lot of her precious time. She began having doubts about this ERP. It was like an empty swimming pool that took a long time to fill. She wished she could take a dip soon. All her anger and frustration was directed at B-the ERP Champion. She decided to play a prank on B.</div><div><br></div><div>B had inducted himself successfully in the organisation. He talked freely and carried the smile of a cat that swallowed the canary. Although he was well-versed with the office dynamics, there were a few things he was yet to fathom. Veena knew that their office had a fire alarm which was faulty; So did most of the employees. The office boys were Veena’s well-wishers. She was always polite to them and spoke their language. Veena made a plan.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On one fine Thursday afternoon, when the office staff was quietly working, the &nbsp;FIRE ALARM RANG! B thought it was a real threat. He jumped out of his chair, climbed on his table,crossed the side-table and ran out of his cabin. 56 people on the floor just stared at him while he ran for his life. Nobody else moved. All of them knew the alarm was faulty. After twenty minutes of waiting outside, B realised nobody had stepped out of the office. He meekly came back. The sales manager went to him and said, “Ye toh aise hi bajta hai, bhagne ka nahi”.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Veena’s prank gave her a lot of satisfaction; however, she felt sorry for B. In Fact, she felt so guilty that she decided to seriously apply herself towards using ERP, for her day-to-day transactions. A dedicated attitude resolves major hurdles in ERP Installation. She read the documentation carefully. &nbsp;After initial hiccups her system started working seamlessly. She began making her sales orders on ERP. Most of her emails were sent automatically by the system. B had assigned her sales territories in ERP and thus her leads were not visible to other sales employees. B had also set her user permissions in a way that nobody could tamper with her data.</div><div><br></div><div>Guilt drove Veena to embrace ERP. In the end though, she was the benefactor. ERP gave her that extra time . She did get a ‘life after office’. B and his ERP became her real heroes.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>   ","2013-10-16",1,"Management"

Actualy school's ground is not enough for the student and corporation asking to school to surrender some land to wider the River (Nala). If school surrenders their some land from school and our children wanted to play in the school. Then the school should have to take our children out of town for play.</p>

"","scaling-erpnext-with-mysql","Scaling ERPNext with MySQL","rushabh","","<p><em>(Suggestions Wanted)</em></p><p>Scaling is what I call a ""good"" problem to have. As we keep adding customers and trial accounts, our servers have started showing signs of overloading. To give you an idea, we have close to 100 live ERPs and another 100 trials running on our server. Each account is a separate database instance with over 200 tables. Here is our configuration:</p><ol><li>Intel i7 8-core processor, 1.6GHz</li><li>24GB RAM</li><li>Seagate 1500GB hard disk.</li></ol><p>As you know our database is InnoDB (MySQL) and the current size of our InnoDB file is 16GB.</p><p>Though we are reasonably passable when it comes to writing software, none of us is an expert in infrastructure issues and system administration, though Anand comes closest to being somewhat qualified. So here is what we did.</p><h3>Analysis</h3><p>To monitor the system performance we use:</p><ol><li>MySQL Slow Query Log: This records queries that take long to execute.</li><li>MySQL processlist: we keep refreshing this to see how many pending queries are there at one time.</li><li>HTOP: The nice graphical utility that shows how the CPU and RAM are performing.</li></ol><p>The usual suspects for any performance issues are RAM and CPU utilization. So, initially when we received complaints of slow responses, we checked all the above and we did not see anything unusual, the CPU and RAM were well below usage. It was only during upgrades that we saw all the 8 CPUs being fully used.</p><p>The slow query log showed something unsual though. Apart from the occasional complex join query, most of it was filled with ""COMMIT"" statements. If you know a bit of database, this basically means the point where all the updates are becoming ""permanent"" i.e. being written to the disk.</p><p>My first reaction was that - now this isn't helpful. I mean its not telling me if the write is slow for an Invoice entry or a Stock entry or something like that, so I went back to the processlist to see what tables are getting locked, which is not too helpful either. Its like trying to read the destination written on the sides a running train, which I occasionally try to do when I am waiting on the railway platform.</p><p>Sometimes when you start a line of thinking, you miss the obvious. I assumed that we can improve our performance by identifing which part of the code can be optimized, because I believed that we had enough hardward to get this running. I ignored the writing on the wall.</p><h3>Realization</h3><p>Finally, it struck me, in what we call in Mumbai, a classical ""tubelight"".</p><p>The hard-disk was the bottleneck!</p><p>So I started to investigate a bit and reading a few blogs [1]. The first thing you get is into RAID systems and how you can optimize performance on them. Now since I am a compelete newbie, I had heard the word RAID before, but had no idea, also it is something that we needed to decide at the time of setting up the servers. Since we were well past that, I looked into ways on how to veryify if my hypothesis is correct.</p><p>In Linux you can find almost anything you are looking for and I was looking for a utility called iostat. This tells me how to monitor performance of the disks. After learning a bit on how to read iostat, &nbsp;I realized that the key figure I need to look at to test my hypothesis was the amount of write instructions on the disk. The next thing I wanted are benchmarks, so that I know what is a resonable average queue size.</p><p>Unfortunately there was no benchmark available, but a lot of people had posted what their iostat outputs. When I saw this, it immediately became clear that the amount of stuff we were writing was very high:</p><p>So I think we can conclude that along with the above table and the ""COMMIT""s in the slow query log, the hypothesis is correct, the bottleneck is the hard disk. You can process as many parallel requests as you can but all need to queue up to write on the disk. Apart from that, we also have a web server running, and god knows how many logs waiting to write.</p><p>This means that while the status of usual suspects, RAM and CPU was this:</p><p><img src=""files/express.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""427"" alt=""Express"" data-mce-src=""files/express.jpg""></p><p>The status of the hard-disk was this:</p><p><img src=""files/traffic.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""427"" title=""Traffic"" data-mce-src=""files/traffic.jpg""></p><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>Now that our stupidity is obvious, we need to quickly decide what to do. I read up a bit on RAID, but its seems an added level of complexity. What I am thinking is adding more servers with fewer accounts on each server, with not as much RAM and CPU horsepower. This will give us capacity to add low cost machines and balance the traffic between memory and disk.</p><p>If you are an expert, would love to hear from you.</p><h3>Post Script #1</h3><p>Thanks for the awesome response. We are running a master-slave setup (for redundancy). We need binlogs not only for this but also for debugging.</p><p>Here is some more info:</p><h4>my.cnf (stripped)</h4><p>This is basically the standard config that gets shipped with Percona release with some increased caches:</p><pre>[mysqld]

"","simple-vs-easy","Simple vs Easy","rushabh","","<p><em>This is a guest post by Anand Jeyahar. You can read his blog at 
<a href=""http://www.blog.anandjeyahar.in/?page_id=1146"">http://www.blog.anandjeyahar.in/?page_id=1146</a></em></p>

<p>I recently came across this short note on <a href=""http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/11/11/simple-versus-easy/"">simple vs easy</a>. 
It triggered off a couple of thoughts on the nature problems faced on a 
ERP product development and the reasons for the nature of ERP market as 
it is right now.  As I am currently an outsider to the ERP field altogether, 
feel free to point out flaws in my hand-wavy theory. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Complexity of features: There are a wide variety of features usually 
associated with a ERP product. There is also a need/requirement for 
inter-operability between these features. Simplifying a product means, 
pruning a lot of these features and sometimes pruning the level of depth 
of inter-operability between them.</p></li>
<li><p>Migration to a new ERP: This is one area where that post strikes at 
a core problem. Namely, the user is very familiar to the old ERP and 
has trouble learning or trying out a new product. Not to mention the 
Data schema migration involved. Which is classically a big PITA problem. <br />
Infact, this is one of the areas, where there arises a communication gap 
between user's needs and the developer. The user says he 
wants (invoicing/accounting/etc..) process to be simpler. 
When for the most part, he means he wants it to be easier/more familiar 
to something else he has used. But simpler from the developer's view point 
translates to less fields to manually fill (aka default values). 
Less fields altogether and a sleek clean looking form.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""getting-on-the-treadmill.html"">Getting on the TreadMill</a>: Adopting a ERP 
software is to adopt a set of standards and operating procedures to the way 
your business is run. Typically, this is run so as to help the business 
scale/grow across people, places, offices, cultures etc. 
As Rushabh points out in his blog, it is a boring, regular commitment to
an exercise regimen. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I would like to use this <a href=""http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/11/05/ancient-rivers-of-money/."">rivers of money</a>
metaphor from Venkatesh Rao here. 
So a business is like a river/stream of money. It starts out as a wild, 
turbulent flow of water rushing down from the mountains looking for a 
place with lower altitude and taking the shortest cuts and routes 
whenever possible, combining with other streams nearby, gathering force 
and momentum, till it grows into  a big river and flows into the plains 
at a steady and relatively laminar flow, irrigating the lands it passes 
through, till it nears the sea, where it again splits into multiple 
branches and merges into the sea. </p>

<p>Most startups are at that wild, mountain stream stage. A ERP software 
becomes the most important at the plain stages, where the flow 
is reasonably laminar/predictable enough to feed vast agricultural lands, 
irrigate them and encourage more economic activity around them. At the 
wild stream stage, the requirements are slightly different. There the 
function of ERP software is more akin to Dams to generate hydel power and 
regulate the flow of water to the agricultural area. </p>

<p><strong>My hypothesis:</strong></p>

<p>ERPNext simplifies most of the features and follows ""explicit is better 
than implicit"" model.  Most users of existing ERP software are not aware of 
the depth and complexity of these inter-operability and when migrating 
to erpnext they are surprised by the simplicity.  But very soon, 
are disappointed by the lack of the familiar and implicit 
inter-operabilities/assumptions they had gained from previous ERP software.</p>

<p>Therefore I suspect majority of ERPNext users are businesses that are 
in a phase of transitioning from a wild mountain stream into the 
steady,laminar flowing river of the plain agricultural lands.</p>

<p><em>What do you think?</em></p>

<p>Do let me know, where my analogy/metaphor breaks down. Also please point out the details i have missed, that invalidate this theory.</p>

Even the book seems like other success stories where the man achieved everything from nothing, it is more than that.

He describes his various phases of life like war, friendship, traveling and adventure before quitting the Army.</span></font></p><p class=""p2""><font face=""serif""><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;""><br></span></font></p>

The confidence and energy oozing out from this point onwards. He converted a bare land which always attacked by monsoon floods, to a huge yielding farm. And he achieves this by not using modern methods, but using the balance of nature. Later he starts a motorcycle franchise, hotel business, agriculture consultancy, one after another, also tries to deliver as a politician.</font></span></p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><font face=""serif"">In most of his decisions, he is clever, responsible and ready to take the risk.

<div>Walter Isaacson does a brilliant job of writing this biography. It is meticulously researched and doesn't soften up Jobs' personality. It delivers an honest rendition of Jobs' life from various perspectives, collected via numerous interviews with those
    involved in his life. You could see a level of perfection in the writing and flow, which even Jobs wouldn't have called <i>a piece of shit</i>.</div><div><br></div><div><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;"">The book introduces us to a young and precocious Steve, who is deeply affected by his adoptive father. From an early age, he was imbued with the lesson that even the invisible parts should be cared for. It shocked me to learn how deeply he was involved
    into vegetarianism and the teachings of ""Neem Karoli Baba"", when most people just show skepticism. He was also into LSD, which he later claimed to have made a big difference in making him who he was. His independent thinking led him to drop out of college
    and pursue any course he fancied, similar to what the character of Rancho did in the movie </span><i style=""font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.428571429;"">3 Idiots</i><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;"">.

</div>
<div>The first act describes how the two Steves met and created Apple Computers. Steve Wozniak was the engine and Steve Jobs was the driver. It describes their journey from manufacturing in a garage to the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I"">iconic Macintosh ad</a> in
    1984 and Apple Computers going public. Steve's focus on design was perceived unusual and as an annoyance by many at Apple. But using, what was called by many as ""Reality Distortion Field"", he would put forth arguments so passionate and powerful, that
    people would have no choice but change their minds. The book describes events without a filter and lays bare, the atmosphere, the people, the causes and the effects of the existence of Jobs. It becomes obvious, what caused his ousting from Apple.</div>

    <br>
</div>
<div><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;"">His second coming is generally attributed to NeXT, but from the book, it seems that it should also include Pixar. Unfettered from what was becoming a profit oriented company, he went to fulfill his imagination with cube shaped computers at NeXT. They failed miserably, but the NeXT operating system would later become the core of Mac OSX, known as the Darwin kernel. At the same time, his interest at the intersection of computers and arts led to him buying Pixar from Lucas Arts. Here, the reader learns his willingness to respect other artists and give them their space. His experience in negotiating with Disney also helped him prepare for what he needed to do to offer iTunes Store to the music industry and the world. These ten years away from Apple gave him the opportunity to start a family.</span>

</div>
<div>Jobs believed in a hindu saying: ""For the first 30 years of your life, you make your habits. For the last 30 years of your life, your habits make you."" He was afraid that after a certain point, poeple stopped being creative. In the third act, he defied
    his own beliefs and that of the world's. He revived Apple when it was deemed impossible to do so and his vision gave rise to the iMac, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App Store, iPad and iCloud - an eco-system of seamless end-to-end consumer experience. Apple
    was no more just a computer company, it became the most valuable tech company in the world. The story so far seemed a lot like the legend of a phoenix rising from its own ashes. Behind this success was his unflinching focus on making perfect products.
    He was ruthless and fired incompetent employees (in his view) so that the company only had ""A Players"". He even managed to be the CEO of Pixar and Apple simultaneously, before selling Pixar to Disney.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>His success was interspersed with his battles with cancer. The stubbornness of Jobs in taking treatment, his food habits and him accepting his affliction is described so well that the reader would clench their fists or shake their head once in a while,
    so as to express their frustration at the behaviour of Jobs. Yet, you could not but admire him. Even in his pain, he passionately cared about Apple and its future, sometime more so than his family.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>Jobs - The Movie only covered the first 20% of the book. The book is rich in details and that makes it very difficult to summarize. You cannot just squint and find out the most important parts of his life. It was the whole journey that makes it possible
    to gauge and make sense of this visionary, and Walter Isaacson makes the reading experience thoroughly sublime. It exudes authenticity and hard work and makes you want to recommend others to read it.&nbsp;</div>

<div>When <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jherbst"">Jason</a> visited our office, he was surprised to learn that we admire Apple. Apple is as closed a company as there can be. I now understand the roots behind it and that this closed nature enabled Apple to provide a great user experience. It was their
    way of making great products, and they made it happen. People focus on the ""closed"" part and not on the ""great product"" part. We admire how Apple is dedicated to make great products. We just choose to do that the open source way.</div>

"","teaching-to-learn","Teaching to Learn","umair","I never really learnt anything until I started to teach. Here are some of my experiences.","<p>There is just one week left for the final exams and my niece is not prepared at all. Her private tutor has raised her hands and said that she is not to be held responsible for the results. I decided to take up the challenge and to teach her maths and science in the evening, while my wife volunteered to take care of rest of the subjects in day time. This task for me has an obvious objective to prepare my niece for finals, and a selfish reason for me to recap the maths I learnt in school.</p>
<p>As a student, maths was terrifying to me. The exercises never help me connect with real world. For example in learning trigonometry, what was the benefit <strong>sin</strong>, <strong>cos</strong> and <strong>tan</strong> the same in real life? Or how a moving car with tyres rotating at 720 degree in a second would do good for me? In fact how tyres can rotate at 720 degrees at all when there are only 360 degrees?? I scored though, thanks to my tutors who gave it lot of importance. In reality I was clueless about where and how to apply maths.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I would have never got the answer to these question if I would not have joined an engineering company. In ERPNext, I learnt from my colleagues what the all-powerful <strong>x</strong>&nbsp;is. The alphabet that haunted me for a good ten years, started finally making sense. The programmers around me would use it all the time to put validations and derive final value from various variables while designing a software application. But I never applied it myself, until an intern, Pratik Vyas joined the team. (Watch out for him, I think he is a great programmer in the making).</p>
<p>I received an assignment from client to extract the basic price of an item out of tax inclusive price. I gave it a try in spreadsheet with some formula but was nowhere close to correct answer. Pratik help me form an equation on top of which we derived the formula to get basic rate of an item. This is how formula was derived.</p>
<p><strong>Given:</strong> Tax inclusive price (TIP) and Tax Rate (T)</p>
<p><strong>To Find:</strong> Basic rate (lets call that X)</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">TIP =&nbsp;X + X * T%</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">TIP =&nbsp;X + (X * T / 100)</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">TIP = X (1 + T/100)</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">X &nbsp;= &nbsp;TIP /&nbsp;(1 + T/100)</p>
<p>I entered this formula in spreadsheet for one time and just dragged it to calculate the basic price for hundreds of items listed below. I tasted real flavor of mathematics and loved it. It was when I realized that maths is not about getting right answer. Maths teaches you basic phenomena of HOW TO THINK. And I realized a good three years after I completed my graduation!</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>So, now when I am teaching my nice (for the selfish reason I told you about), I see her at the same place where I was in my school days. With every problem, I try and give her a real life example so that she can map it with real world. We recently took Identity chapter in which we learnt about Expansion Equation. The problem was to calculate an square of big number, say 53. The formula was to put the value 53 in a way it becomes easy to get square of it. So 53 can also be written as (50 + 3).</p>
<p><img src=""files/Maths.png"" height=""276"" width=""290"" /></p>
<p>This was the question asked to my programmer colleague in job interview for profile worth 100 grand per month. My friend gave the right answer. Unfortunately the interviewer was only interested in right formula. The formula my friend used was not same he was expecting. And it was one of the negative for him not clearing that interview.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>So, what I am trying to ask is this, why not teach maths which helps student (like me) map maths problem with read world? I believe merging mathematics with basic programming can bridge that gap.</p>
<p>Yes, Programming. Because just like maths, even programming teaches us how to think. Also, it&rsquo;s very convenient to apply maths in programming, which is not that simple in other streams of engineering like civil, mechanical engineering etc. For example, the basic maths calculation of addition, subtraction, division and multiplication can be put into real life scenario by asking student to make an spreadsheet listing students marks in each subject, calculate percentage and generate rank for each student based on percentage scored.</p>
<p>The unjust world we live in, the weightage of right or wrong depends on who says it. The words of Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg will certainly have lot more weightage than mine. Check below what they say about Programming and Education.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc</a></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Confession</h4>
<p>I bluntly raised my hand at my niece when she didn't pay attention. I am really sorry for that. No one had ever raised their hand on me for whatever I did. All I wish is to see her scoring highest in all subject and taste success.</p>
<p>I am selfish again.</p>","2013-03-25",1,"Personal"

"","test-cases-encountered-the-most-wanted-reserved-qty-bug","Test Cases Encountered The Most Wanted Reserved Qty Bug","nabin","Oh! No. Not Again! This was my first reaction when I discovered an open support ticket is awaiting for me since 3 days.","<p><em>Oh! No. Not Again! </em></p>
<p>This was my first reaction when I discovered an open Support Ticket was awaiting me since three days. It was raised by Aditya Duggal, one of our early customers and the most active member of the ERPNext community. Since I am the resident expert on this issue, and I was on leave, the ticket remained open.</p>
<p>Looking at the subject of the ticket, a guilty feeling came into my mind. I was frustrated with the issue, as it has bugged me several times even after fixing it at a regular intervals. But this time I was determined to fix the root cause, with the power of our new ""Test Suite"".</p>
<div style=""color: #6e6e6e;"">
<p><em>The Issue:</em></p>
<div class=""well"">Reserved quantity for the item CSE07000060-411 showing as 5 Nos in BGH655 warehouse whereas we don't have any pending orders for this particular item.</div>
</div>
<p>Reserved Quantity is the quantity, which is reserved for delivery to the customer. It increases on submission of a Sales Order, and reduces when a Delivery against that Sales Order is made. The value is maintained in a table called ""Bin"", a unique combination of item and warehouse.</p>
<p>Unlike past, this time I did not dive into the code directly. I started with writing automated test cases.</p>
<div class=""well"">
<p>Case 1: Create Sales Order (SO) with stock items. Submit and Cancel it, check reserved qty after each step.</p>
<p>Case 2: Make Delivery Note (DN) against an SO, with partial delivery and submit it. Stop and Unstop the SO, Cancel DN and Cancel the SO. Check reserved qty in each step.</p>
<p>Case 3: Follow same steps as case 2, for over-delivery against sales order</p>
</div>
<p>All the testcases passed without any error. I was not able to think of any other test case. But the error in Aditya's account confirms that there are some cases where it is going wrong. Then I realized that I totally forgot about packing items. Immediately I looked into it and tried to cover those test cases.</p>
<div class=""well"">
<p>Case 4: Create packing item and Sales BOM for that item. Follow same steps as case 2 with packing items.</p>
<p>Case 5: Follow same steps as case 3 with packing items for over-delivery.</p>
</div>
<p><em>And here it goes!</em></p>
<p>The Case 4 failed while stopping SO after partial delivery. I was very excited but wanted to make sure that I wrote the right test cases. After digging into deep, I found that the quantity being updated while stopping was wrong. I completed test cases for over-delivery of packing items as well before moving to fix the issue.</p>
<p>While fixing the issue, I realized that the code should be refactored, as it was very difficult to read. Test cases gave me the license to go ahead with rewritiing the code.</p>
<p>After refactoring the code, I was very glad, all the test cases passed smoothly. I realized the power of writing automated test cases, which helped me to catch a bug that was eluding me for almost 2 years. Now I try to write every piece of code with atleast minimal test cases.</p>
<p>After fixing the issue, I was traced back my step to understand how this issue bugged me in the past. I am pasting here full email transcript between Aditya and me. If you are curious to know, please click <a onclick=""javascript:$('#HiddenDiv').toggle()"" href=""javascript:;"">here</a> [Warning: It's a long conversation]<br /><br /></p>
<div id=""HiddenDiv"" style=""display: none; color: #6e6e6e;"">
<p><em><b>Aditya [18-04-2011]:</b><br />I would like to inform you that the projected quantities have gone all wrong in the BIN doc type and these are very important for us to know what to manufacture. Now the projected quantities are getting messed up due to the RESERVED QUANTITY being wrong in the doc type. I think the problem is somewhat with stopping SOs as it should reduce the reserved quantity but I think it is not doing that, I am not sure about it but honestly speaking most of my items are showing reserved quantities but they are not on orders.</em></p>
<p><em><b>ERPNext [18-04-2011]:</b><br /> It is working fine in our side. So we need to track the exact scenario for such an error to occur. For now, we are recalculating the reserved qty for all the items.</em></p>
<p><em><b>Aditya [09-05-2011]:</b><br /> Please check this as it is creating a lot of problems for us, the reserved quantities in BIN DOCTYPE is not equal to the sum of quantities to deliver for that particular item code. Please let me know why this error is coming again and again, there something that we are doing is making this error come again, since I could recall Saumil had earlier rectified this error.</em></p>
<p><em><b>ERPNext [09-05-2011]:</b><br /> I investigated the first case - for item CSE08000100-411 1) Total SO (booked) qty as per Sales Order Detail is 124 2) Total delivered as per Delivery Note Detail is 115. Hence reserved should be 124-115 = 9, but in stock level report, it is showing 11. This is because in SO111200230 - you have delivered 4 against 2, hence you will still have reserved some more against some other SO. Hence the number of 11 is correct because you have over-delivered in another Sales Order. This is also because you are allowing over delivery by 100% as set in your Settings -&gt; Global Defaults. To stop over-delivery, make this number smaller!</em></p>
<p><em><b>Aditya [10-05-2011]:</b><br /> Thanks for the detailed analysis. I would like to know the best possible way to move forward, I have for a start changed the global defaults and disallowed any over-delivery but the thing is that now how should I change the reserved quantities to match up with the actual qty to deliver. Now the only thing which comes to my mind is that I manually change the values of reserved quantities in the Bin doc type, is that thing fine or there is a better way to do it. Please let me know.</em></p>
<p><em><b>ERPNext [11-05-2011]:</b><br /> Finally, we had identified the exact issue in reserved qty. It was not related to logic of reserved qty calculation. Basically, there was a bug in the system related to attachments. When you attach any file in a submitted document, the document converted to Draft. Thats why it allow to re-submit the document, hence double addition in reserved qty. The problem has been fixed. And I had submitted sales order SO111201132, please amend if required.</em></p>
<p><em><b>Aditya [16-06-2011]:</b><br /> This problem is still persisting, kindly let me know how to see the root cause of this problem.</em></p>
<p><em><b>ERPNext [24-06-2011]:</b><br /> Investigated almost 1 full day but did not find the exact reason of getting reserved qty wrong except over delivery, may be due to old bug. I have recalculated quantity(ordered, reserved, projected, actual etc) for all item. Now hopefully, the system will give correct projected qty for all items.</em></p>
<p><em><b>Aditya [30-06-2011]:</b><br /> Please check the items mentioned below, they all have their reserved quantities different from the actual quantities to be delivered. This bug is really creating problems for us. Did you check the code for reserved quantities when we ""STOP"" or ""CANCEL"" a Sales Order? I think the problem should be in that.</em></p>
<p><em><b>ERPNext [05-07-2011]:</b><br /> You are right, I did not considered Stopped document while recalculating reserved qty. Now reserved qty is sync with qty pending to deliver. Thanks for pointing out the exact mistake.</em></p>
<p><em><b>Aditya [05-07-2011]:</b><br /> I have checked the items and they are indeed in sync as per expectations, let&rsquo;s hope no errors creep in this time.</em></p>
<p><em><b>Aditya [03-08-2011]:</b><br /> The problem has re-occurred, but this time I think the problem is not wide spread but just related to one or two SOs. The below mentioned items were booked under 2 SOs whose ID is mentioned, now 891 was a repeat of 890 so I had cancelled it. Now before canceling 891 the reserved quantities were 18,18,18,28,30,15 respectively. Now as per my analysis it seems that the system is considering SO890 twice for reasons unknown to me. Please let me know when this is resolved. Now this is something which is still not going good.</em></p>
<p><em><b>ERPNext [03-08-2011]:</b><br /> Did not find any problem in reserved qty for any of the following items. Can you please tell how you get/calculated this reserved qty.</em></p>
<p><em><b>Aditya [03-08-2011]:</b><br /> Checked it myself, now the difference is not showing even in my report but for only one item CSE12000150-411where the bin table also shows the reserved quantity as 1 but I cannot find a single order in which this item is pending to be delivered.</em></p>
<p><em><b>ERPNext [04-08-2011]:</b><br /> There is 1 sales order SO111200657 where this item is pending to deliver. Probably in the custom report you did not considered null value. We have put a validation in the system. It will check if reserved qty gets wrong at any scenario. It will give a message and do not allow to submit the transaction. It will help us to find out the exact scenario where it is getting wrong.</em></p>
<p><em><b>Aditya [01-08-2012]:</b><br /> This problem seems to have crept into the system again. Or this is not a problem, please elaborate and also let me know how could I check how this error crept into the system.</em></p>
<p><em><b>ERPNext [06-08-2012]:</b><br /> We have fixed reserved qty for item HSQ09530200-040, but could not fix for other item JCNO-01 because that needs manual operation. In Sales Order SO121300304-1, packing list table did not populated properly due to one old issue, that resulted wrong reserved qty for that item. Please amend the mentioned sales order, it will fix reserved qty.</em></p>
<p><em><b>Aditya [27-09-2012]:</b><br /> Reserved Quantities of the following seems to be wrong to me: HSQ31750150-040 and HSQ03180150-040. Please let me know how this error creeps all the time.</em></p>
<p><em><b>ERPNext [01-10-2012]:</b><br /> We did not find any issue in reserved qty for the mentioned items, seems they are correct. Sales Order: SO121301538-1 is not showing in PENDING ORDERS report because company is different in that sales order.</em></p>
<p><em><b>Aditya [19-02-2013]:</b><br /> I have just noticed that in RIGPL account, erp.rigpl.com there is a problem with the posting of reserved quantity for one item. The item is CSE07000060-411 which is showing as reserved quantity as 5 Nos in BGH655 warehouse whereas we don't have any pending orders for this particular item. Kindly let me know why this error is occurring, you can access the account for admin purpose for resolving this particular issue. </em></p>
<p><em><b>ERPNext [22-02-2013]:</b><br /> I am very glad to inform you that finally ""Reserved Qty"" bug has been identified and fixed. We have written extensive test cases for reserved qty calculation, so minimum chances of introduction of new bugs in the future. The issue was related to ""STOP"" functionality. Reserved qty also recalculated for all items, it was wrong for 4 items.</em></p>
<p><em><b>Aditya [22-02-2013]:</b><br /> Glad to know that this bug has finally been caught, I can still remember it took something like a year or so for getting hold of this bug (hope all the cases are now covered in the new script).</em></p>

"","the-computer-and-me","The Computer and Me","rushabh","How computers were introduced in my life and what they mean to me today.","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I never knew that the first computer I had access to, the BBC Micro, was commissioned as by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) as an educational machine, to spread computer literacy, in response to a popular TV Show. I now know that, courtesy of the Wikipedia, and the internet, that today connects probably more than a billion computers. My intention is not to bore you with my nostalgia, (ok maybe a bit) but it is also a reflection of how far we have travelled within a couple of decades.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When I was a school kid, computers were an exotic accessory. I was probably ten (1989) when those BBC commissioned computers landed in our school. My school had started a short course on computers in the summer vacations, and my parents had enrolled me into it. I recall that I &ldquo;got&rdquo; computers right from the beginning. I did not feel any anxiety or confusion that I often felt in school otherwise, specially when I had to deal with teachers and older students. No, I was not a recluse, but like most children, I was not designed to be a machine that produced answers when some teacher pointed at me. Which is why I always found them very over-powering and dangerous. Computers, on the other hand were a piece of cake.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The very first program I wrote was a calculator. You had to input some numbers, choose an operation and the computer would promptly display the answer. It was just a few lines of instructions that seemed to read like poetry with short sentences written on separate lines. It was written in a language called BASIC, that I would use for many more years to come.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The course also had an exam. In the exam, we were asked to make a billing program where a user would buy, say a television or a radio and the program would spit out the total bill amount. All this was many years ago, but I still remember that this was one test I scored well. I remember standing next to my school captain, the haughty Sachit Balsara, and I can remember he kept looking at me as I went up to the instructor to get the test results, probably surprised that how a clumsy kid like me could score more than him.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I don&rsquo;t know what small victories can do for you in life, but that one probably changed mine. I was an average student in class and never generally did very well, but this was one time I was better than everyone. It just gave me the confident start I needed. It was like I had discovered a super power for myself and life suddenly had a new dimension.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The second computer I got access to was a Sinclair machine, another British import. My best friend Amit&rsquo;s dad was an enthusiast and an entrepreneur, who had also started computer classes. He had a small shop in our neighbourhood where he would repair televisions and in the tiny attic, he would run computer classes. He had just moved back from Britain to settle in India. I still remember that we could write and read programs on audio cassettes on those machines. Shrikant uncle had a nice collection of games in those cassettes that he allowed us to play occasionally, till they went bad.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When I was probably twelve, I remember waking up once in the middle of a dream where there was a computer at home that I could write BASIC programs in. Luckily for me, that dream was about to come true. One of my uncles, who was working with one of India&rsquo;s first computer companies, had done a deal to replace a bunch of old computers from a bank with newer ones. He needed a way to get rid of the old computers and what could be a better way than giving the opportunity to one&rsquo;s own family members. Hence courtesy of the nameless bank, I had a PC in my house. I remember it cost us something like Rs 3,500 ($70) at that time.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The monitor was old fashioned monochrome and could display very little graphics. It was probably good for me because the only thing I could run on it was the DOS operating system and BASIC programming. And I remember I explored it fully and wrote tons of kid programs, egged on by Shrikant uncle. Amit, his dad and myself were the only computing community around and we had a lot of fun making a all kind of programs. Games never interested me because they made me anxious. I loved watching them though. Amit would play games and I would watch and then I would program and he would watch.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I remember Amit got a brand new 286 machine and we loaded a new kind of program called &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; on it. You could use a mouse and it had a graphical interface. It was really cool. Immediately I went back on my old machine and wrote up a program that would emulate the Windows look. You had a bunch of boxes on the screen that you could use to list and start programs on your machine. I quickly realized that running my &ldquo;fake Windows&rdquo; was taking up half of the computer memory, and the main program was left limping.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Since we had no access to the wider computing community, nor was there any such thing in our school, our only real access was via books and pirated disks that you could buy at Mumbai&rsquo;s computer street, Lamington Road. The first computing book I bought, for better or worse, was Peter Norton&rsquo;s Guide to the Assembly Language. That book took me under the hood of the operating system and showed me how the microprocessor, which is the heart of the computer interacted with the memory. Memory is where programs, their inputs and outputs were stored. The microprocessor would read very basic and dumb instructions from a memory location, like <i>add this</i> or <i>move this here</i>, and how with thousands of such micro-instructions, you could create something very interesting and complex.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In a couple of years, my community was expanded as my elder cousin Samir started to take a lot more interest in computers. I figured that like me, he instantly &ldquo;got&rdquo; computers and was happier dealing with them rather than other human beings. Unlike me though, he loved playing games. He then became my source of cool things. He showed me advanced forms of BASIC alike QuickBasic and VisualBasic along with new games like Wolfenstien and we would spend hours discussing new types programs and ways we could hack into the operating system to do something cool.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Samir later went on to become a successful software product designer and entrepreneur and was an inspiration for me to start my own software company.&nbsp; My touch with programming diminished in the years of board exams. By the time I was in college, Samir was already on his own and operated out of his own small office. I would spend my summers with him working as an apprentice, and often pair programming on complex geometric problems for his product. Later I learnt that pair programming is an established practice even though we just happened to stumble on it.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">These days I have a love-hate relationship with computers. Computers have now moved on from solving complex mathematical problems to becoming embedded in the structure of our civilization. They have also become a means of communication, transforming lives and replacing or enhancing other popular forms like books, newspapers, telephones and televisions. Even though I love writing programs like I always did, I am not fully comfortable making it my profession. The reason is that I am very anxious to deal with customers, who like my teachers, are always asking questions, that I am not fully prepared or capable of answering. Which is why I think hobbies should become professions only when its on your terms.</span></p>","2013-02-24",1,"Personal"

","<p><p><a data-mce-href=""http://erpnext.com/erpnext-the-real-review"" href=""http://erpnext.com/erpnext-the-real-review"">Read the first part here</a></p><p>It’s already been three months I have been evaluating different ERP packages. While other vendors are restless and follow up with me every week, ERPNext sales team looks least concerned. Not a single follow up call from them. But they were kind to extend my trial account twice and their chat support has been very helpful. I have decided to sign up with ERPNext!! And when I informed the same to other vendors, whose software I was evaluating simultaneously, they called ERPNext a Fake ERP?? What does that mean? Well, let me have a final call with Umair to close the deal.</p><p>Me: “Hello”</p><p>Umair: “Hello. ERPNext.”</p><p>Me: “Hi Umair. I am ready to sign up.&nbsp;</p><p>Umair: “Great!! Do you need an Invoice?</p><p>Me: Yes. Send me a Invoice. Will you come over to my place to implement solution?”</p><p>Umair: “No. We don’t make site visits. Our rock-bottom pricing doesn’t allows us do leg work.”</p><p>Me: “Ok. I trust your online support. But any discount possible?”</p><p>Umair: “Sorry. No scope for discount. Our pricing is Rock-bottom already.”</p><p>Man, this guy Umair sounds like a robotic human. He has answer ready before I complete my question. But his advice about project champion has been helpful. My manager is quite ambitious, experienced and always shown acceptance to new software I try to implement. I have asked her to keep in regular contact with Umair and she managed to get the software functional in two weeks time. That was impressive.</p><p>-</p><p>I started adding employees in the system and assigned them roles as per their job profile. As always, they are restricted to adapt to new technology and switch from legacy software which is as good as religion for them. They find forms in ERPNext too lengthy and always have excuse of week internet connect ready when I ask them about uncompleted task. But when I passed through them, my purchase guy has already updated the picture of goddess in the background of his ERPNext account and Sales guy updated his daughter picture as profile pic. They had no usability issue in making Expense Claims and chatting on Messages engine of ERPNext!!</p><p>After setting up my Letterhead, &nbsp;this has become <em>our</em> ERPNext account. Two weeks gone and I see my Customers, Suppliers and Items data up-to-date in the system. Also, my users made couple of Quotations and Purchase Order and print formats are quite decent. </p><p>It looks like every other day I login, there is something new. And sometimes there are bugs too. When I inform Umair about it, he calls it an UPGRADE. Oh yeah!! He asks me to create Support Ticket. I wondered it must be a form like contact us which I need to submit. But it was even simpler. Just email your query on support@erpnext.com and system creates support ticket. Trust me or not, the response from ERPNext team to Support Ticket is as fast as an auto-response. Infact, couple of times, I miss took it for auto-response.</p><p>Also, it was via Support Ticket I started talking with other team-mates of ERPNext. Prakash would generally thank me for reporting the issue and assure that issue will be fixed in sometime. Nabin and Anand have no time to waste and their message is crisp and to the point. Fixed. Issue Fixed. Problem Fixed. its intereting that even the founder, Rushabh responds to customer’s Support Tickets. Usually much faster than auto-response and his messages even more concise than the messages of Nabin and Anand.</p><p>Well, it’s been around a month and my business is getting on auto-pilot mode. My users love the copy feature a lot and this has improved the response time to customer by huge margin. I can effectively manage my receivables and generate reports on my own. Right now, I am inserting images in items so that I can generate and maintain website within ERPNext, just like sample website Umair showed to me. He said website will be compatible to view in small screen of Mobile as well. I am just desperate to get it working.</p><p>And now, I am monitoring my business and activities of my employees via ERPNext while I am on family holiday, sitting under the beach side shack at Goa. </p><p>But I won’t write a testimonial for them, until they drop a couple of emails requesting for it.</p></p>","2013-04-04",1,"ERPNext Customer Stories"
"","thoughts-on-product-release","Thoughts on Product Release Cycles","rushabh","","<p>This is the second time in the last six months that we are reworking on
a major part of the product. The <a href=""http://erpnext.com/open-day-august-2012.html"">last time</a>, we lost steam in two months.
Though we <a href=""https://github.com/webnotes/erpnext/tree/dev"">scrapped that work</a>, 
it became a testing bench for a lot of 
ideas that were brewing in our mind. This time though we are confident of 
completing the work but after frentic development in the first month, 
the pace has definitely slackend.</p>

<p>So why this lack of urgency? I think it is because we are some way away from
a release. When a new project starts off, there is a lot of creative energy
that is unleashed and when the project is near release, the energy comes
from the feedback that you anticipate from the users and
the satisfaction you get from seeing a finished product and using it yourself.</p>

<p>When a project is between the initial energy and the completion phase,
it becomes a challenge to maintain pace. One solution is to be smarter
about how much development is done in one such cycle. I am beginning to
think that a 2-3 week cycle from development-to-release is ideal. Any feature
that is going to take longer will take much longer.</p>

<p><a href=""http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/"">Usage is the oxygen for new ideas</a></p>

<p>New ideas come when something is actually used. The human
mind thrives on feedback as Bret Victor beautifully explains in his
talk (its a long video but totally worth it). 
Any release that goes on and on
deprives the human mind of feedback and builds up fatigue.</p>

"","to-be-or-not","To Be or Not to Be","rushabh","","<p>Couple of interesting things happened in the last few days. Since we
released the new version, there was (and still is as I write) a heavy
support load. During this time, new customers were not so patiently 
waiting for us to setup accounts. One customer from Russia put finally
said it ""It's easy to get the impression that you really like making software, 
you just don't want to sell any"".</p>

<p>Last evening M dropped in to have a chat. He told me, you need to really
start selling. ""Hire a few of people for tele sales, and since you
are already getting incoming leads, its just a matter of getting on 
the line and closing the deal. I have seen this over and over again. I have 
seen with my own eyes how Zimbra (open source email server) made it big. 
I used to work in their
call center. They just started calling customers and the money flowed in.
They sold to Yahoo for $350 million of dollars. I know a couple of other
companies that have made it big the same way.""</p>

<p>""But who will put in the money? What about the product? Will it stand
the volume? You know, I have been through this real tough time last
few years and I am not willing to take any more risk."", I questioned. </p>

<p>""I have investors who I have talked to. They seem interested."". He seemed
very keen on getting me out there.</p>

<p>""Yeah but investors want 10x returns. I am not ready to commit any numbers
just because I don't know. And I really don't have the time and energy
to make presentations and pitches. The problem is that the Indian startup 
scene is full of hustlers. They are after the Angels and VCs and the 
investors think they are celebrity. They don't even reply to emails.
One of the Angel Groups wanted my presentation 'urgently', but there was
not even an acknowledgement once I sent my presentation. 
You know what, if they need 10x returns 
on their money, they better respect my time."". My experience so far
had not been very good.</p>

<p>""Get this straight, you are just a product guy and you should keep doing that.
No product is going to sell unless you sell it. You need people who can
close deals on the phone. You need to jack your price up, pad it for the
extra sales costs. I know you have a really good product, I am using it
myself, but its an ERP. It will take implementation and support and hence
if you want to grow fast, you need to setup that call center fast."", M
was really on my case.</p>

<p>But I was not giving up easy. ""Why should I jack up my price? All the
SAAS pricing out there is real nonsense and is huge bubble. You know
a Macbook Pro with the world's best operating system costs you around $1000.
An iphone costs a few hundred dollars. 
There is no way a simple SAAS project management, CRM or helpdesk product
is worth hundreds of dollars a year. Also, I am very hungry to improve my
product at the moment, because I know it still has a long way to go. Even
if you plan works and we start selling a lot, its just going to increase
our disconnect. We need the product to improve first, the sales will
happen automatically.""</p>

<p>We left it at that. Internally I knew he had a point, but that was not
the path I was on. As long as we paid the bills, money making is really
not the objective right now. Its improving the product. 80% of my effort
goes there. I know we are in a real good market because of the quality
of leads we get, and the lack of real competition, but there is still a
long way to go.</p>

<p><em>p.s. Secretly, I am happy that so many startups are raising funds, even if its
for the humble helpdesk. They might just lay the foundation for more companies
like us to build on. In meanwhile, we will just accumulate customers, features
and steadily improve our product.</em></p>

After working on server administration, where things were usually black and white, I found erpnext to be a patchwork of greyer shades. There were usually multiple ways to achieve the same result and it all came down to design decisions and experience. Every time I tried to solve a ticket, I had to dig deep into the code and at the same time, get my concepts cleared, most often from Nabin (He has an immense amount of patience).</span>

    <br>
</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<blockquote>Debit and Credit not equal for this voucher: Diff (Debit) is 0.00280000000021
    <br>Did not save</blockquote>
<div>Somtimes, customers used to face this error. It would bewilder them. Where did 0.0028 come from?&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>They saw rounded figures in the form. But, the values stored in variables weren't rounded. When you clicked on the field to edit it, you could see the stored value. The rounding was just for display. What you saw wasn't what there was.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>Similarly, there were problems with Write Off Amount in Sales Invoice. If the Grand Total was 149.60 and the Customer paid 150, the user would write off -0.40. But, the Grand Total stored was something like 149.597342. Hence, the user would get:</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<blockquote>(Paid amount + Write Off Amount) cannot be greater than Grand Total
    <br>Did not save</blockquote>
<div>I hate inconsistency. So, these issues seemed to arise just to taunt me. But, the calculation code at its core was very complex and I lacked the understanding to untangle it. The simpler and immediate solution was to tell the customer to adjust a value.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>The problem escalated when we implemented tax inclusive prices. It involved calculating tax exclusive amount from the inclusive amount, given tax percentages. Once the tax exclusive amount is calculated, the code for forward calculation kicked in, and
    calculated the tax amounts from the percentages.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>One would expect that:</div>
<pre>tax exclusive amount + tax amount for that item = tax inclusive amount</pre>

<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>But, this wasn't always the case. Reverse calculating tax exclusive amount involves division, while the forward calculation of tax amount from tax exclusive amount involves multiplication. Such sequential division and multiplication often caused floating
    point errors.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div><b>What are floating point errors?</b>

</div>
<div>A computer uses floating point representation of real numbers. It looks something like:</div>
<pre>Significant digits × base<sup>exponent</sup></pre>

<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>Floating point representation reduces the storage requirements when calculations are performed, thus speeding up calculations by a factor of 10 or more.&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, not all real numbers can be accurately represented using floating point system. Hence, for the computer, 150.1 is 150.09999999999999, the nearest number it can represent. Again, what you see isn't what there is.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>To solve such problems for good, we decided to round-off values after each operation, so that, what you see is what there is. With our latest release, such issues were fixed. (Mostly. There might remain some edge cases, which we may discover later).</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>But, rounding has created a new problem for those who use tax inclusive prices. Suppose, 4.35 includes 21% VAT. So, you get:</div>
<pre>Tax exclusive amount = 4.35 / (1 + 0.21) = 3.595 = 3.60 (rounded to 2 decimals)</pre> and,
<pre>Tax amount = 3.6 * 0.21 = 0.756 = 0.76 (rounded to 2 decimals)</pre>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>Here, we can see that:</div>
<div>3.60 + 0.76 = 4.36, which is not equal to 4.35. A difference of 0.01 arises.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>Even with a Gaussian rounding algorithm that reduces such accumulated errors in the long run, the errors aren't completely eliminated and organizations have to write-off such an accumulation at the end of a period.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>It also indicates that a split up of 4.35 cannot be accurately represented using 2 decimals. From another perspective, <span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;"">there is no two decimal number, that will yield 4.35 when a tax of 21% is applied on it.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The immediate solution is to either:</div>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;"">Increase precision of stored values, such that 3.595 + (0.21) * 3.595 = 4.35, or</span>

        </li>
        <li><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;"">Change 4.35 to 4.36, such that 3.6 + 0.76 = 4.36</span></li></ol><div>We believe that the 2nd option is the right way to go. We can automate this so that the code will correct such prices to representable ones, which in this case is to change 4.35 to 4.36 for that Item. What are your thoughts?</div>
</div>

<div><span style=""line-height: 1.428571429;"">This one problem got me started with accounting, selling and buying modules of erpnext. Yet, I get the feeling that it hasn't been solved completely. I await the edge cases.</span>

After five years, we are still grappling with the question.","""Why am I feeling lost"", Nabin asks me after lunch ""I feel that things are not moving fast enough. Why don't we raise funds or hire new people""<div><br></div><div>This is year 5 of startup number 2 and Nabin has seen it all. I am more circumspect. I tell him that I think the product needs more polish. The people whom we pitched for funds are not very interested. And yet, we have doubled our revenue in the past 2 years, twice, so we are doing okay even though the number is still not big enough. But I can understand where he is coming from. I have harboured these same feelings for the past few &nbsp;years. These days I realize the kind of path we are on and am circumspect about exponential type growth. Here is a very abstracted thought on how and why.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Firstly let us inquire into the nature of success. Success is momentum, success is getting large number of users or revenue quickly, success is about raising funds, getting written about and being noticed. Some parts of society are in motion, i.e. have momentum and some parts move, but slowly. Some parts of society are shrinking. Now if someone wants to get success quickly, it is better they become a part of an existing momentum in society rather than create new motion. Creating new motion is extremely hard and takes a lot of effort. Its like ploughing a land for the first time or taking a path that is not yet formed.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Startup centers like Silicon Valley and Stanford University have momentum. People who have momentum form networks so that they can share each others momentum, and as more people join them, their momentum increases. Venture Capitalists and Angels are centers of such momentum, so teams that want to get success quickly should try to join them. Leaders in momentum networks in turn have to realize that they cannot pick losers, because if they pick losers, then not only will they not succeed, the momentum of the entire group or network will fall. Such networks are often based on past associations like, people who went to the same school or the same league of schools. In earlier times, these used to be based on community.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Momentum network also share cultural traits, like aggressiveness or polish or a taste that gets copied by all the members. Members benefit from these traits and are immediately tagged as successful. Members are also the first ones to have access to privileged information which is shared as a currency in such networks. Members are also highly skilled in different skill sets and everything put together, increases their success rate. And this becomes a virtuous cycle.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>On the other hand are teams that are not directly plugged into any such networks. Teams like ours, who depend on ""excellence"" to create momentum. This excellence does not come by copying someone else's behaviour, but by introspective and analysis. Patterns are discovered by repeatedly doing the same thing unless it feels right. Information is not shared, but assimilated in oneself and one must be tuned to find this out. Such teams rarely do something great in a very short period of time and their best bet to success is to stay put for the long run. The focus has to be on survival and excellence at the same time.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Obviously, there is no right way. There are two very different ways and often the second one does not get written about. The conflict arises when the team is not clear about the path. Everyone wants to take Path A, but it is not always that you get to be part of the momentum network. Also by being a part of the network, may involve compromising on some of core values. So Path A is not always the best. Path B is is harder to discover. The external environment, specially since ubiquitous communications favours the aggressive, will push everyone towards Path A. You have to allow Path B to come to you.</span></div><div><br></div><div>I think we have almost discovered Path B, though sometimes we get astray and fall into the seduction of Path A and feel lost. I don't think there is anything wrong in that because thats how we keep discovering.</div>","2014-02-03",1,"General"

 after addressing approximately 1500 bug related issue in past the two 
years, finally we learnt how to prevent working features from breaking 
when new features are released. It was achieved via automated testing 
system called Test Cases. In simple words, it is script written for each
 transaction / master. When the script is run, it automatically creates a
 record, checks validations and returns the final result as True or 
False. This has made our release process much more stable than earlier. 
And if we see, using test case is also an upgrade in our process for 
automated testing.</p><p>Continuously upgrading not a choice for 
business and individual. But it’s a basic need for surviving in this 
competitive world which is moving ahead so fast. We at ERPNext have 
benefitted a lot by our philosophy of constantly innovating and 
upgrading our product. Change is a constant of life, so why not embrace 
it?</p>   ","2013-06-03",1,"Inside ERPNext"

If you deal in physical goods it might be a good time to start.","<p><img src=""files/upcbarcode.jpg"" class=""with-shadow"" data-mce-src=""files/upcbarcode.jpg""></p><p><br></p><p>In a supermarket, more than 90% items are recognized by barcode reader / scanner. We have all noticed that, whenever the cashier of the supermarket scans a barcode using a laser device, item description and price appears in the computer screen. Do you know how the magic works?&nbsp;</p><p>A barcode, is a code using multiple lines and spaces of varying widths, designed to represent some alpha-numeric characters. The barcodes generally are read with a laser scanner, which measures reflected light and interprets the code into numbers and letters. The barcode scanner passes the data to the attached computer or stores it to it’s internal memory.</p><h4>How it Works</h4><p>A barcode represents any alpha-numeric data, for example, in retail, it generally represents item code / serial number.&nbsp;Most barcode scanners behave like an external keyboard. When it scans a barcode, the data appears in the computer screens at the point of cursor.&nbsp;</p><p>In supermarkets, the cashier points the mouse cursor in entry field of item code / serial no in their POS screen and then scans the barcode using laser scanner. Immediately item code/serial no appears in the screen, and POS software does the rest of job. It fetches product description, unit of measurements and price of the item, which are already maintained in the database.</p><h4>Printing Bar Codes</h4><p>A barcode is usually printed with special type of printer called “Barcode Printer”. It generally uses direct thermal or thermal transfer technique to print. Barcode printers comes with a software, which can print thousands of barcodes at a time, and able to read the data from an excel file or directly from database. Unfortunately, they can not print anything else and are pretty expensive.</p><p>Dedicated barcode printers are not appropriate for someone who is just getting into barcode labeling. Starting out, most people want to keep their investment to a minimum, until they are sure about the outcome. In this situation, a free barcode font can be used with help of a word processing software.With a barcode font, you can use your existing laser printer to print the barcode labels. Many free barcode fonts are available and you can easily download and install them in your computer. These days, barcode scanning software is also available for mobile, though those are not good in quality, it can be used to start.</p><h4>Where to Use</h4><p>Barcodes are most often used by super markets and retail stores, but it can be used in every business around the world. For example:</p><ol><li>It can used for asset management, to track assets in any building including desks, computers, telephones etc.</li><li>To checkout books from a library</li><li>At the time of stock reconciliation in the stores</li><li>To track manufacturing and shipping movements</li><li>To help security guards to identify every employee, every door they enter and work in.</li></ol><h4>Using Barcodes in ERPNext</h4><p>ERPNext also offers the feature to track items using barcode. You can enable this feature from Setup --&gt; Features Setup.&nbsp;Once enable, you will find a field named “Barcode” in item master, where you can specify barcode for an item.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=""files/barcode_item.png"" class=""with-shadow"" data-mce-src=""files/barcode_item.png""></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Barcode field will also visible in Purchase Receipt, Delivery Note and Sales Invoice item table.

Every phase is usually pre-planned, a definite goal &amp; direction is set. Moving to a new direction for completion is the achilles for such technique.

Once the programming is initiated, the next step is automatically known and step-by-step the project is built. Updations &amp; error(s) solving are also very flexible. Programmer(s) are not restricted and can come up with their whole programming skills and wide imagination.

Patience Programmers - These type of programmers have ample time for programming. They pre-plan each &amp; every phase, divide the work into multiple sections with each given specific time for completion. They prepare work architecture, flow-charts, diagrams, decision-making, etc. which takes a hefty time but essential for successful completion of work. Then at each phase they analyse their work and watch if each section is completed in its given time. They usually follow 'Planned Programming'. They think they have years to complete a task.

"","what-does-erpnext-do","What Does ERPNext Do?","priya","ERPNext's newest team member Priya tries to explain to her 72 year old father what does ERPNext do.","







<p class=""p1"">My father was very curious to know what my new company does. I remained silent for some time. I was trying to figure out a way to explain to him in words&nbsp;he could understand. He is 72 years old. He only understands the meaning of the term computer. He was a serial entrepreneur in his time. As far as software is concerned, he has no idea what programmers do? What is coding? What is HTML? What exactly does a software engineer do on a computer?</p>
<p class=""p1"">I took a deep breath and began explaining. I started with the small businesses he did back in 1970's. He had a milk dairy. He had an ice factory to cool the milk. He had a furniture and interior designing firm. He also had a retail general store. Oh yes, he also had two restaurants.&nbsp; All these were located in different states and different towns.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1"">I began by telling him, that at ERPNext, computer engineers write a package which facilitates accounting. I told him that if he had this package back then, he could have stored all the names of his milk suppliers in this computer program. He could keep a note of all the payments that he had to give his suppliers. He could also&nbsp; note all receivables from his retail customers. I told him that he could check his profitability and manage accounts in an easy manner. One click on a box and he could get a report on whether he is making profits, exceeding expenses , or making losses. “ Oh! so you guys are accountants” he concluded. No!&nbsp; we are not accountants! I objected. I pointed that ERPNext builds a mechanism for accountants, human resources, manufacturing, sales etc to store information and access it at the click of a button. He didn't look very impressed.&nbsp; So I tried harder.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I reminded him, how he had problems maintaining every employees records, their payments, their leaves, etc. I told him that ERPNext also has a human resource package attached along with accounting where you can store employee details, salary details, and contact information. All this can be accessed and managed very easily. Each employee's tax components, their LTA, medical bills, other details , all can be managed very easily. Even salary slips of each employee which would&nbsp; differ based on roles could be printed at the click of a button. No hassels! He looked interested. But that was the only emotion he exhibited so far.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I was very keen on impressing him. It mattered a lot to me what my father thinks of my new company. It was very important for me that he respects the work that I did and the work that my company does. So I braced myself and continued. I prodded him to recall how much trouble he had managing 5-6 small businesses which were located in different states and towns. I reminded him that he had to visit every enterprise just to sanction their leaves, manage payments, or monitor supplies. He had issues giving complete financial control to his accountants. He also didn't want to give complete accesss to his purchase manager. He had to veto most purchases which involved large amounts of money.&nbsp; I told him that ERPNext package helps manage information of more than one company. You could keep all the information of companies located in different territories on this package. I elaborated that he can even specify who will have access to which information. He could give partial or complete control of permissions to the managers he chose. And he didn't have to travel to all the locations to do this . He could approve or deny at the click of a button. He could&nbsp; have saved on all those travels and took us to the ice-cream parlors more often. Now he seemed very interested.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1"">Happy with my progress, I explained further that this package also stored all purchase invoices, delivery notes, sales invoices, customer information etc. All the customers data, contact details, product specifications, raw material details, etc. everything can be kept in one place. Now came the time to super impress! I informed him that there are large computer companies in US who sell this kind of stuff to large enterprises for approximately 10 million including installations, servers and consultations. They also take a lot of months to streamline the whole installation process. I could see that he was wondering in his mind, why companies spent so much for a little covenience. He decided that he was better off without this ERP business. Then, I revealed that ERPNext charges very very less.It is designed for small enterprises. I pointed that our&nbsp; prices are fixed for all types of&nbsp; customers and we charge 1/10th of what other large ERP&nbsp; providers would charge medium and small business enterprises. He began paying attention again. Now he was clearly impressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1"">I should have left it at that. But I didn't. I went ahead and told him that this software is very good because it is open source. It can be accessed by professionals all over the world, it is free and anybody can improve it, if they want to. I got a little excited and told him that the program is stored on a Github site where it can be developed and forked by different users. I had him confused. He looked like he didn't care whether it was Github or Bathtub. Slowly his attention started dimming. I said the software is based on python and Apache. I could see that he went down his memory lane and remembered the day he had shooed away a python who entered his cow shed.&nbsp; Well, I left him alone with his thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1"">Next time I will prepare myself sufficiently to explain open-source in words that he can understand.&nbsp;</p>   ","2013-07-23",1,"General"

I enjoyed there Tata culture and learnt lot of things. As my role was cashier cum clerk and I got basic knowledge related Sales and Accounts. I want say thanks to Mr Sheth, who had given me that opportunity and I got chance to work with them.</p>
<p>But since I joined Web Notes as 'Admintrative Officer', I am performing different role in company. I joined as an administrative officer but I got chance to learn many different things, since it was a startup. That time I had very little knowledge of accounting in Tally and was totally unaware of ERP software. Rushabh gave me basic training of an ERP system. Also I was given an opportunity to do real data entries in system. I was really happy because with that data entries we finalized our Balance Sheet for that year.</p>
<p>So how did I learn accounting? For our developers and sales team we were arranging training sessions on accounting in office and every time we took the case study of our tea stall owner. With that example we understood accounting basics. The first rule is to always keep in mind that all Assets &amp; Expense accounts are Debit accounts and all Liabilities &amp; Income accounts are Credit accounts. This basic concept of accounting helped me more in ledger creations and making journal entries in ERP system.</p>
<p>Statutory work of Web Notes helped me to understand taxation rules of government. In India it is very difficult to open new company because there are lot of formalities and registrations you have to complete. You need to take different licenses from different authorities. (For e.g You need to take Shops and Establishment license from local corporation, you need to register with Central Govt for Service Tax, &nbsp;also you need to register for Professional taxes and Employee Provident Fund (social security).<br /> <br />Work culture of Web Notes has given me big opportunity to learn new things. This has been possible with the help of my colleagues. Every day I learn something new which helps me to improve and become more confident. &nbsp;</p>","2013-03-08",1,"Inside ERPNext"

<div>Anything is excess is harmful. So does games. Addictive game players suffer from various physical and mental disorders. The controlled situation of game doesn't let the person accommodate comfortably in real scenarios where situation is not controlled.
    This has reached a level that we have addiction centres providing cure to youngsters who are powerless over their addiction. Smith and Jones Addiction consultants, based in Netherlands is first to have formed a program to detox people from ill gaming

<div>Just like gaming, social networking and mobile messaging applications gets us in same vicious cycle. Just like the addiction increases gradually, the rehabilitation process also takes time. Gaming addiction is like food addiction. We should learn to

"","why-erpnext-is-so-affordable","Why Is ERPNext So Affordable","nabin","","<p>All of you know that ERPNext is an open source ERP, built to serve small and medium businesses. It is loaded with features, easy to use and completely online. The most highlighting point is its affordability, compared to all other products in the same category. But do you know how is it so affordable?<br /><br />The main reason lies inside the company&rsquo;s philosophy. We believe all other ERPs are extremely over-priced. A small business owner can&rsquo;t even think to invest in an ERP software. There are other open source ERPs, which either are very complex to deploy or leave a lot to be desired. So, we decided to provide an ERP at a reasonable price, which will help them to manage their businesses in a better and organized way.<br /><br />We understood that most of small businesses do not have proper resources and expertise to manage the infrastructure, required for hosting an ERP product. Whether it is on their premise or with a third party hosting provider. It is an extra burden on them as well as an additional expense. Our SaaS offering solves their pain points. The price is 1/10th or less compared to other products (For more detail see <a href=""compare-erpnext.html"" title=""Compare ERPNext"" target=""_blank"">Comparison</a>).&nbsp;<br /><br />A year and so after going live, we realized that there are lot of users who have technical expertise and can deploy the product themselves. The product could also benefit from a community. So, we decided to make it open source.<br /><br />To maintain its affordability, we follow some rules:<br /><br /></p>
<ol>
<li>We have no sales team. All of our customers come on their own volition, by discovering the product on the internet or through recommendations. To evaluate ERPNext, one can see an online demo or create a 30 days free trial account.</li>
<li>Our marketing expenses are limited&nbsp;only&nbsp;to Google Ads.</li>
<li>We do not provide onsite support. We have tried to keep ERPNext, easy to use. If required, we provide help via&nbsp;chat, email and public forums.</li>
<li>We host our servers with an international data center. We believe that they have better expertise and infrastructures to manage it and this helps us to keep our focus on the product.</li>
<li>ERPNext has been built using open source technologies, so there are no licensing costs.</li>
<li>Basic customizations like new fields, permissions and workflows can be done by the user. If specialized customizations are desired by any customer, we leave it for the community to come forth and help them out.</li>
<li>Currently, only three developers are managing the product. Most people find this hard to believe. :)</li>
</ol>
<p>We are always trying to make the product better and more affordable.<br /><br />Thank you for your keen interest in ERPNext.</p>","2013-02-02",1,"General"
"","why-there-are-so","Why there are so Few ERP Startups","rushabh","","<p>My thoughts on why there are so few ERP startups among thousands of new web 2.0 startups:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Young founders don't understand enterprise: Most startups are founded by young kids who are in college or right of out college. Problems faced by companies are not their problems. The best startups are built around problems that the founders have faced themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>An ERP is a very complex app: An ERP has so many entities that are tied up in numerous layers of relations to various other entities and the complexity of the interactions is very high. It takes months if not years to understand many of these interactions.</p></li>
<li><p>Accounting is hard: Apart from the hierarchical structure (that can neatly be modeled using the nested set model) of the chart of accounts, there are numerous reporting requirements, constraints, conditions and dimensions.</p></li>
<li><p>Older devs are happy: People who ""can"" build ERPs, the older devs, already have steady jobs and clients. Risk appetite is inversely proportional to age. It is highly unlikely they are going to risk their well paying jobs and build a new system from scratch</p></li>
<li><p>ERPs have long gestation period: The functionality is atleast an order of magnitude more (if not two) than a usual social app, hence the period of time the application will take to mature will be much longer</p></li>
<li><p>Established players have no incentive: Established ERP players are building new web based ERPs but they are too expensive. The are used to a particular cost structure and they will never compete with ""startups"" in building low cost ERPs because its against their DNA.</p></li>

"","working-in-the-zone","Working in the Zone","rushabh","","<p>This is motivated by Jacques Mattheij's recent <a href=""http://jacquesmattheij.com/living+in+the+zone"">blog</a>.</p>

<p>Recently I have been having amazing productivity in my work and have been hitting the ""zone"" quite regularly. Here is what I think gets me there. The big difference with Jacques's blog is that these are mostly internal factors:</p>

<p><strong>1. Inspiration:</strong> To be in the zone I have to be reasonably inspired. Since I primarly build for the web, I get inspired by other startups and design firms that come up with fantastic work. 37signals is a regular source of inspiration, so are my customers who are using my product. Those few occasions when my customers allow me to access their account (for fixing bugs), I am totally impressed by how deeply they are using the application and its a source of high and inspiration to do better.</p>

<p><strong>2. Confidence:</strong> Since I have been writing code for over 15 years now, I have built a reasonable skill set. A new features / simplifications seem within reach. Even if I am refactoring code, there is a new ""level"" of confidence in the way I go about things. The places where I break the functionality, or the way I write Object Oriented code is very different from what I used to do even a year back. Now I don't have second thoughts on whether this is the ""right"" design. After years of failing with bad design, I think I have learnt from my mistakes.</p>

<p><strong>3. Stamina:</strong> After a project (or a sub-project) is done (like done-done), you realize that atleast 30% is remaining. At first, I would walk away to another project, but now I realize that that 30% is the killer in terms of usablity and making it high quality. So putting that extra-bit to make it really polished is also helping me higher satisfaction and keeps me in the sweet-spot where I am constantly looking to improve.</p>

<p><strong>4. Inner Peace:</strong> For the last couple of years, the lack of success of my startup was bothering me deeply. I would be extremely stressed about the fact that I have not been successful compared many others. This anxiety would lead to bad decisions about strategy, recuritment and everything in general. Recently, I went through a meltdown and decided that things must change. It was very hard process but at the end of it, I think I unlocked another level of the ""zone"". I think I have made peace with myself and my pace of doing things. I let things come to me rather than going after them. I think that really helps me when I am writing code.</p>

"","writing-web-notes-style","Writing Web Notes Style","rushabh","Why we take writing so seriously and how we bumped into a serious writer like Priya.","<p>Hiring a writer has been a problem area for us for many year. Reluctantly, I put an ad yet again on a popular job site. I liked Priya's resume and asked her to prepare a sample writeup introducing Open Source to a non-technical person. Here is what she
    sent us:</p>
<div style=""padding-left: 20px"">
    
<h3>What is Open Source (Attempt #1)</h3>

    <p>There are some people who believe that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Things which appear to be free are always paid for in some way or the other. Open source software is like a free lunch. Some believe it is free, some don’t.</p>
    <p>When a particular software program is written by a programmer for the general public free of charge, it is called open source software. This software can be run and studied by mass users. They can change it, upgrade it or distribute it. This software
        is created by a group of professionals who keep the code open for improvement by other peers. Due to this practice a product that is largely bug-free is evolved.</p>
    <p>Some of the open source software’s are Linux, Mozilla Firefox, Apache HTTP Server, osCommerce etc. Linux is a freely distributable operating system which runs on different platforms. It is free and thus extremely popular as compared to the proprietary
        operating systems. Partially non-free GNU/Linux and its derivative Android, an operating system for mobile devices has stormed the markets. Proprietary software’s like the Apple, or Windows are struggling to retain their market share. The mobile market
        that uses Android is capturing markets at a very fast pace. One starts wondering why this free lunch? What is the development philosophy of this software that is free? The rationale behind this movement is that a larger group of programmers who are not
        concerned with proprietary ownerships or financial gains design these products. They are satisfied with peer recognition and freedom to make powerful reliable software. Some thrive on fun and challenge of doing it; others hope that they will profit from
        add-on tools and paid technical support services.</p>
    <p>If you are a business group who wish to compete with large organizations, with limited budget to spend on software, open source is your answer. It gives greater penetration and competitive advantage like Android gave to Micromax. It is reliable and inexpensive.
        It thrives on quicker innovation and flexible technology. Open source is also open to hackers who know about the weaknesses and loopholes of the software as compared to the closed source software. Thus, if you are in a business that requires fierce protection
        of your data, open source is not a good recommendation.</p>
    <p>Open source is moving into ERP (Enterprise resource planning and CRM (customer relationship management). You can manage accounting, inventory, sales and a lot more at an affordable package. You can say bye-bye to expensive license fees and vendor lock-ins.

<p>That was a reasonably okay writeup, but lacked a punch. Explaining what I wanted, I sent her <a href=""http://www.inc.com/magazine/20100501/why-is-business-writing-so-awful.html"">Jason Fried's wonderful article on what is wrong with business writing</a>.
    But considering the poor quality of responses I got, I still thought it might be a good idea to interview her. Within a few hours, she sent another writeup:</p>

<h3>What is Open Source (Attempt #2)</h3>

    <p>I was a die-hard Nokia fan. Nobody on this earth could convince me into buying a Samsung. I was their most loyal, staunch customer. Nokia had brand value, good battery life and most important of all, every time it fell on the ground and broke in to pieces,
        I could still put it back together. It worked every time. It rose from the ashes like a phoenix.</p>
    <p>Today, I have a Micromax! What made me dump my most trusted brand? Simple, I got a brand that had all the features of a Nokia, cost less than half of what a Nokia would cost and gave me a system which was new , stylish, easy to operate and didn’t break
        into pieces, every time it kissed mother earth. Nokia was waiting for its proprietary windows operating system. I couldn’t wait. I got a Micromax which operated on Android. It was fast, easy to operate, and sleek. The market offered me Samsung. You see,
        why pay 40,000/- when you can get the same features, look and feel for 10,000/. So that was the main reason why I shifted my loyalties. I saved my money. Open source software is your option to save money. If you are trying to compete with industry stalwarts,
        if you are concerned about breaking even, if you want to give cutting edge technology and good quality product without going bankrupt, open source is your answer. Android is partial non-free open source software. Some others are Linux, Mozilla Firefox,
        Apache HTTP Server, osCommerce etc.</p>
    <p>When a particular software program is written by a programmer for the general public free of charge, it is called open source software. This software can be run and studied by mass users. They can change it, upgrade it or distribute it. This software
        is created by a group of professionals who keep the code open for improvement by other peers. Due to this practice a product that is largely bug-free is evolved.</p>

        Embrace the new affordable technology and give the industry giants a run for their money.</p>Priya Shrivastava

    <p>Now, I was totally impressed. This was great. I shared it with everyone on the team and they found it great too.</p>
    <p>Hiring is tough, but if you look hard enough, I think you can still find what you want. There is a saying in Hindi ""If you look hard enough, you will also find God"". So keep looking!</p>
