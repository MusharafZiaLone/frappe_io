And it getting even more complicated, if you all items with a different VAT (lets say books with 7% VAT and CDs with 19% VAT) in one goal the shipping cost must have a VAT calculated based on the ratio of the sold items.\n\nmeans: you have a book for 10,-EUR (with 7% VAT) and a CD for 10 EUR (with 19% VAT) in one parcel your shipping cost VAT rate is based on the ratio of the sold Items. In this case with the assumption of 10,- EUR shipping costs you mud calculate 50% of 7% VAT and 50% of 19% VAT. \n\n\n ",
