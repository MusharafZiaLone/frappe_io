  "comment": "**@Aditya** Thanks for the feedback! I will keep it simple henceforth. \n\n**@Laurence** pushState is a browser's functionality that lets a developer customize browser's Back button functionality. A trick lets you use it to download only part of the web page, similar to what happens within the ERPNext app - i.e when you go to #List/Sales Invoice, the browser only fetches the needed information and not the whole titlebar, form code, etc., which was already downloaded when the desktop was opened. This functionality is now available on web pages too. Hence, you get a similarly fast browsing outside ERPNext too. We were inspired by Twitter and Github, which uses pushState to improve user experience and speed. ",

Currently if a user has a report right for Sales Orders then all reports based on SOs are seen by the user but many a times there are cases when we have around 20 reports based on SO but we only want a particular role see or access only say like 3 reports would that kind of a thing be possible.\n\n",

The website mittal.erpnext.com is having a bigger screen size than what is generally given in erpnext website. I would love to know and hope someday we would also have our website on erpnext.\n\n3. It is a great thing that new APP module is coming which is going to give a lot of new apps (I hope) from the developers.

It could have been easily avoided by creating hosted trial account of ERPNext. Companies should outsource the non-core activity.\n\nImplementation of ERPNext is as good as setting up a virtual instance of your company.

Implementation never took off, because we struggled with where to even start...do we start with data entry for account...input our customers....enter our current stock items etc and quickly discovered that our main problem we tried bridge the ERP knowledge, with our business and IT. I know there are several separate guides for each module, but it would be awesome to have implementation walk through from start to finish for a manufacturing org (like an installation guide...not even an software wizard), business can skip modules if they don't do manufacturing but only sales. </p>\n\n<p>Agreed with Umair on commitment, we are willing to take that step to retrain our staff to use the process and procedures....but first we have implement it.

We usually recommend standard well known software/infrastructure since vulnerabilities are well known and as long as you keep your systems patched, you have a smaller chance of attackers finding holes. </li>\n<li>Lot of recent recommendations have been to move to the \"cloud\" for your infrastructure needs since they are more secure, thoughts?</li>\n</ul>\n",

Like I said, the last update in every query is updating the Session table, basically to track session timeouts. I think this table gets locked out. Recently we have memcached the sessions and only update the Session table once every 30 mins. I will have to revisit this code once more to check if there are no leakages here.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing is that we have a metadata driven engine. The metadata itself is stored in tables and this gets frequently queried. This gets memcached too. But as you pointed out, out the bottleneck is in the writes so this might not be the cause.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks everyone for all the follow-up comments. This has been very helpful.

Right now slave is only as a fail-safe incase master fails (which has happend once) and it takes many hours to restore 200 odd databases. We also do snapshot backups on the slave. Binlogs also help us in debugging.</p>\n\n<p>@Amit, have posted the output from the perl script in the blog. Thanks for this.</p>\n\n<p>@Chris, since we are running an ERP application there are many writes - users entering accounting and inventory transaction information. Until a few weeks, we also used to update sessions in the db, but we now use memcached for database and only update the db once in 30 mins.</p>\n\n<p>@Piyush, posed my.cnf in the main blog.</p>\n\n<p>I have one other doubt, unfortunately we have not separated GET and POST requests so our engine runs a start and commit on every request. I read that this will clear the table cache - hence the high number of cache clears. I think this is the first thing to fix.</p>\n\n<p>Will also update the logs (both the binlog and the slow query log) in a separate file. Apart from that we also have a web server that serves mostly reads. Will also switch off the httpd access log.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again for all the help.</p>\n",

You need to work out why so many writes. Turn off slow query logging, that's just getting I. The way of diagnosing your performance issues, and it's writing to a log, only making the write bottlenecks worse. </p>\n\n<p>Also... Check how many indexes you have, you may be sacrificing write speed for increased write speed. Shot in th dark, you need to know what queries are causing the writes. Are you only updating relevant fields, not all of them unnecessarily?</p>\n\n<p>Another thing - ensure the transaction log isn't too small. Can cause issues.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and have you also ensured you dot have something other than the database on those servers? Might be something else interfering - e.g. Backup.</p>\n",

Have you split the transaction log from the data files, preferably on a different disk?</p>\n\n<p>Also, put that slow performance logging on a separate disk. In fact, try to turn it off. It can have a performance penalty in its own right!</p>\n\n<p>If you want best bang for buck, and you won't RAID, it's normally recommended to use RAID 10 (or otherwise known as RAID 1+0). Basically it stripes the data, and then mirrors those stripes. It's the most reliable option.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever you do, do NOT use RAID 5, it's just overhead and you telly gain very little in a disk crash due to often lengthy rebuild times.\nGood luck!</p>\n",

  "comment": "SaaS is here in a big way, but a backlash may be coming. I work for a $17B global organization, and we are using seperate SaaS applications (and providers) for talent recruiting, talent management, bonus and incentive management, compensation planning and CRM (and there may be more). First, each application works differently, and data does not transfer easily from one to another. The future may be developing customer-specific UIs that accesses SaaS apps through their APIs, although this would reduce recognition of the SaaS apps (and likely their revenue).\n\nSecond, bandwidth is still expensive and slow, and a problem when large data files are involved. Because of this, SaaS apps will never provide encompasing solutions for enterprise. For example, product data management with 100MB+ engineering design and model files. A parallel internal system for PDM is both inconvenient and adds back another user interface, but more critically may result in synchronization errors with an ERP (e.g., drawing versions). A solution could be a hybrid-cloud SaaS app, with PDM system data hosted locally (although perhaps synchronized to the SaaS app for backup or as part of a a multi-site synchronization strategy).",
