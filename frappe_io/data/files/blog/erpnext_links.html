	ERPNext is a highly complex product having more than 200 inter-connected tables (DocTypes). The visualization below shows relationship between 75 DocTypes selected based on the frequency of occurrence of its link. If you hover the mouse on a particular DocType's arc (box on circle's rim), you will be able to view its relationships in isolation.
