   "main_section": "<p>A Purchase Order is analogous to a Sales Order. It is usually a binding contract with your Supplier that you promise to buy a set of Items under the given conditions.</p>\n\n<p>A Purchase Order can  be automatically created from a Material Request or Supplier Quotation.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/purchase-order-f.jpg\" alt=\"Purchase Order\"></p>\n\n<p>In ERPNext, you can also make a Purchase Order directly by going to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Buying &gt; Purchase Order &gt; New Purchase Order\n  \ufffc</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/purchase-order.png\" alt=\"Purchase Order\"></p>\n\n<p>Entering a Purchase Order is very similar to a Purchase Request, additionally you will have to set:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Supplier.\u2028</li>\n<li>A \u201cRequired By\u201d date on each Item: If you are expecting part delivery, your Supplier will know how much quantity to deliver at which date. This will help you from preventing over-supply. It will also help you to track how well your Supplier is doing on timeliness.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Taxes</h3>\n\n<p>If your Supplier is going to charge you additional taxes or charge like a shipping or insurance charge, you can add it here. It will help you to accurately track your costs. Also, if some of these charges add to the value of the product you will have to mention them in the Taxes table. You can also use templates for your taxes. For more information on setting up your taxes see the Purchase Taxes and Charges Master.</p>\n\n<h3>Value Added Taxes (VAT)</h3>\n\n<p>Many a times, the tax paid by you to a Supplier, for an Item, is the same tax which you collect from your Customer. In many regions, what you pay to your government is only the difference between what you collect from your Customer and what you pay to your Supplier. This is called Value Added Tax (VAT). </p>\n\n<p>For example you buy Items worth X and sell them for 1.3X. So your Customer pays 1.3 times the tax you pay your Supplier. Since you have already paid tax to your Supplier for X, what you owe your government is only the tax on 0.3X.</p>\n\n<p>This is very easy to track in ERPNext since each tax head is also an Account. Ideally you must create two Accounts for each type of VAT you pay and collect, \u201cPurchase VAT-X\u201d (asset) and \u201cSales VAT-X\u201d (liability), or something to that effect. Please contact your accountant if you need more help or post a query on our forums!\f</p><p><br></p><h4>Purchase UOM and Stock UOM Conversion</h4><div>You can change your UOM as per your stock requirements in the Purchase Order form.</div><p>For example, If you have bought your raw material in large quantities with UOM -boxes, and wish to stock them in UOM- Nos; you can do so while making your Purchase Order.</p><p>Step 1: Store UOM as Nos in the Item form.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: The UOM in the Item form is the stock UOM.</p><p>Step 2: In the Purchase Order mention UOM as Box.

It is the key process used to determine whether the money leaving an account matches the amount spent, ensuring the two values are balanced at the end of the recording period.

   "main_section": "<p>The Sales Order confirms your sales and triggers purchase (<strong>Material  Request</strong>) shipment (<strong>Delivery Note</strong>), billing (<strong>Sales Invoice</strong>) and manufacturing (<strong>Production Plan</strong>)</p>\n\n<p>A Sales Order is usually a binding Contract with your Customer.</p>\n\n<p>Once your customer confirms the Quotation you can convert your Quotation into a Sales Order.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/sales-order-f.jpg\" alt=\"Sales Order\"></p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can create a Sales Order directly from:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Selling &gt; Sales Order &gt; New Sales Order</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/sales-order.png\" alt=\"Sales Order\"></p>\n\n<p>Most of the information in your Sales Order is the same as the Quotation. There are a few amongst other things that a Sales Order will ask you to update.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Expected date of delivery.</li>\n<li>Customer Purchase Order number: If your customer has sent you a Purchase Order, you can update its number for future reference (in billing).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Packing List</h4>\n\n<p>The \u201cPacking List\u201d table will be automatically updated when you \u201cSave\u201d the Sales Order. If any Items in your table are Sales BOM (packets), then the \u201cPacking List\u201d will contain the exploded (detailed) list of your Items.</p>\n\n<h4>Reservation and Warehouses</h4>\n\n<p>If your Sales Order contains Items for which inventory is tracked (Is Stock Item is \u201cYes\u201d) then, ERPNext will ask you for \u201cReservation Warehouse\u201d. If you have set a default Warehouse for the Item, it will automatically set this Warehouse here.</p>\n\n<p>This \u201creserved\u201d quantity will help you project what is the quantity you need to purchase based on all your commitments.</p>\n\n<h4>Sales Team</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Sales Partner:</strong> If this Sale was booked via a Sales Partner, you can update the Sales Partner\u2019s details with commission and other info that you can aggregate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sales Persons:</strong> ERPNext allows you to tag multiple Sales Persons who may have worked on this deal. You can also split the amount in targets of different Sales Persons and track how much incentives they earned on this deal.</p>\n\n<h4>Next Steps</h4>\n\n<p>Once you \u201cSubmit\u201d your Sales Order, you can now trigger different aspects of your organization:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>To begin purchase click on \u201cMake Purchase Request\u201d</li>\n<li>To make a shipment entry click on \u201cMake Delivery Note\u201d</li>\n<li>To bill, make \u201cMake Sales Invoice\u201d</li>\n<li>To stop further process on this Sales Order, click on \u201cStop\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Submission</h4>\n\n<p>Sales Order is a \u201cSubmittable\u201d transaction. See Document Stages. You will be able to execute dependent steps (like making a Delivery Note) only after \u201cSubmitting\u201d this Sales Order.</p><h4>Sales Order with Order type Maintenance</h4><div>When the 'Order Type' of the Sales Order is 'Maintenance' follow the steps given below:</div><div>Step 1: Enter Currency, Price list and Item details.</div><div>Step 2: Mention taxes and other information.</div><div>Step 3: Save and Submit the form</div><div>Step 4: Once the form is submitted, the Action button will provide three choices.i) Maintenance Visit ii) Maintenance Schedule iii) Invoice.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Note 1: By clicking on the Action button and selecting 'Maintenance Visit' you can directly fill the visit form.

   "main_section": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 14pt; text-align: justify;\"><span>Subcontracting is a type of job contract that seeks to outsource certain types of work to other companies. It allows work on more than one phase of the project to be done at once, often leading to a quicker completion. Subcontracting is practiced by various industries. For example, manufacturers making a number of products from complex components subcontract certain components and package them at their facilities.</span><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 14pt; text-align: justify;\"><span>If your business involves outsourcing certain processes to a third party Supplier, where you buy the raw material from, you can track this by using the sub-contracting feature of ERPNext.</span><br></p>\n\n<p>To setup sub-contracting:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create separate Items for the unprocessed and the processed product. For example if you supply unpainted X to your Supplier and the Supplier returns you X, you can create two Items: \u201cX-unpainted\u201d and \u201cX\u201d.</li>\n<li>Create a Warehouse for your Supplier so that you can keep track of Items supplied. (you may supply a months worth of Items in one go).</li>\n<li>For the processed Item, in the Item master, set \u201cIs Sub Contracted Item\u201d to \u201cYes\u201d.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/subcontract.png\" alt=\"Subcontract\"></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Step 1: Make a Bill of Materials for the processed Item, with the unprocessed Items as sub-items. For example, If you are manufacturing a pen, the processed pen will be named under Bill of Materials(BOM), whereas, the refill, knob, and other items which go into the making of pen, will be&nbsp;</span>categorized<span>&nbsp;as sub-items.</span></p><p><span>Step 2: Make a Purchase Order for the processed Item. When you \u201cSave\u201d, in the \u201cRaw Materials Supplied\u201d, all your un-processed Items will be updated based on your Bill of Materials.</span></p><p><span>Step 3: Make a Stock Entry to deliver the raw material Items to your Supplier.</span></p><p><span>Step 4: Receive the Items from your Supplier via Purchase Receipt. Make sure to check the \u201cConsumed Quantity\u201d in the \u201cRaw Materials\u201d table so that the correct stock is maintained at the Supplier\u2019s end.</span></p><div>Note 1:&nbsp;<span>Make sure that the \u201cRate\u201d of processed Item is the processing rate (excluding the raw material rate).</span></div><div><span>Note 2: ERPNext will automatically add the raw material rate for your valuation purpose when you receive the finished Item in your stock.\u2028</span></div>\n",

   "main_section": "\n\t<p>A fiscal year is also known as a financial year or a budget year. It is used for calculating financial statements in businesses and other organisations. The fiscal year may or may not be the same as a calendar year. For tax purposes, companies can choose to be calendar-year taxpayers or fiscal-year taxpayers.  In many jurisdictions, regulatory laws regarding accounting and taxation require such reports once per twelve months. However, it is not mandatory that the period should be  a calendar year (that is, 1 January to 31 December).</p>\n\n<p>A fiscal year usually starts at the beginning of a quarter, such as April 1, July 1 or October 1. However, most companies' fiscal year also coincides with the calendar year, which starts January 1. For the most part, it is simpler and easier that way. For some organizations, there are advantages in starting the fiscal year at a different time. For example, businesses that are seasonal might start their fiscal year on July 1 or October 1. A business that has most of its income in the fall and most of its expenses in the spring might also choose to start its fiscal year on October 1. That way, they know what their income will be for that year, and can adjust their expenses to maintain their desired profit margins.</p>",

   "main_section": "<p>Now \ufffcthat you have completed most of the setup, its time to start moving in!</p>\n\n<p>There are two important sets of data you need to enter before you start your operations.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Opening Account balances.</li>\n<li>Opening Stock balances.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To setup your accounts and stock correctly you will need accurate data to work with. Make sure you have the data setup for this.</p>\n\n<h3>Opening Accounts</h3>\n\n<p>We usually recommend that you start using accounting in a new financial year, but you could start midway too. To setup your accounts, you will need the following for the \u201cday\u201d you start using accounting in ERPNext:</p>\n\n<p>Opening capital accounts - like your shareholder\u2019s (or owner\u2019) capital, loans, bank balances on that day.\nList of outstanding sales and purchase invoices (Payables and Receivables).</p>\n\n<h4>Temporary Accounts</h4>\n\n<p>A nice way to simplify opening is to create temporary accounts for assets and liability just for opening. These accounts will become zero once all your old invoices are entered. The two accounts which you can create are (example):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Temp Opening Liabilities</li>\n<li>Temp Opening Assets</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>The Opening Entry</h4>\n\n<p>In ERPNext Opening Accounts are setup by submitting a special Journal Entries (Journal Voucher).</p>\n\n<p>Note: Make sure to set \u201cIs Opening\u201d as \u201cYes\u201d in the More Info section.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Setup &gt; Opening Accounts and Stock &gt; Opening Accounting Entries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Step 1: Select Opening Entry in the Voucher Type section.</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/opening-entry.png\" alt=\"Opening Entry\"></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<h4>Step 2: Complete Journal Entries on the Debit and Credit side.</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/opening-entry-1.png\" alt=\"Opening Entry\"></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<h4>Step 2: Select Yes in the \"Is Opening \" record under More Info.</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/opening-entry-2.png\" alt=\"Opening Entry\"></p>\n\n<p>You can make two Opening Journal Vouchers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For all assets (excluding Accounts Receivables): This entry will contain all your assets except the amounts you are expecting from your Customers against outstanding Sales Invoices. You will have to update your receivables by making an individual entry for each Invoice (this is because, the system will help you track the invoices which are yet to be paid). Since all the entries in this voucher will be of type \u201cDebit\u201d, you can credit the sum of all these debits against the \u201cTemp Opening Liabilities\u201d account.</li>\n<li>For all liabilities: Similarly you need to pass a Journal Voucher for your Opening Liabilities (except for the bills you have to pay). This can be made against the \u201cTemp Opening Assets\u201d account.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After completing the accounting entries, the trial balance report will look like the one given below:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/trial-balance-1.png\" alt=\"Trial Balance\"></p>\n\n<h4>Outstanding Invoices</h4>\n\n<p>After your Opening Journal Vouchers are made, you will need to enter each Sales Invoice and Purchase Invoice that is yet to be paid. </p>\n\n<p>Since you have already booked the income or expense on these invoices in the previous period, select the temp opening accounts in the \u201cIncome\u201d and \u201cExpense\u201d accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Again make sure to set each invoice as \u201cIs Opening\u201d!</p>\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t care what items are in that invoice, just make a dummy item entry in the Invoice. Item code in the Invoice is not necessary, so it should not be such a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Once all your invoices are entered, your \u201cTemp Opening Assets\u201d will be same as \u201cTemp Opening Liabilities\u201d and you can pass another \u201cIs Opening\u201d type of Journal Voucher and cancel them to zero!</p>",

You may or may not make money but your government will (to help your country be safe and prosperous). And if you don\u2019t calculate your taxes correctly, they get very unhappy. Ok, philosophy aside, ERPNext allows you to make configurable tax templates that you can apply to your sales or purchase.</p>\n\n<h3>Tax Accounts</h3>\n\n<p>For Tax Accounts that you want to use in the tax templates, you must go to Chart of Accounts and mention them as type \u201cTax\u201d in your Chart of Item. </p>\n\n<h2>Item Tax</h2>\n\n<p>If some of your Items require different tax rates as compared to others, mention them in the Item tax table. Even if you have selected your sales and purchase taxes as default tax rates, the system will pull the Item tax rate for calculations. Item tax will get preference over other sales or purchase taxes. However, if you wish to apply default sales and purchase taxes, do not mention item tax rates in the Item master. The system will then select the sales or purchase tax rate specified by you as default rates.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/item-tax-1.png\" alt=\"Item Tax\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Inclusive and Exclusive Tax</strong>: ERPNext allows you to enter Item rates which are tax inclusive.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/inclusive-tax.png\" alt=\"Inclusive Tax\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exception to the rule</strong>: Item tax settings are required only if a particular Item has a different tax rate than the rate defined in the standard tax Account</li>\n<li><strong>Item tax is overwrite-able</strong>: You can overwrite or change the item tax rate by going to the Item master in the Item tax table.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Sales Taxes and Charges Master</h2>\n\n<p>You must usually collect taxes from your Customer and pay them to the government. At times, you may have to pay multiple taxes to multiple government bodies like local government, state or provincial and federal or central government.</p>\n\n<p>The way ERPNext sets up taxes is via templates. Other types of charges that may apply to your invoices (like shipping, insurance etc.) can also be configured as taxes.</p>\n\n<p>Select template and modify as per your need.</p>\n\n<p>To create a new sales tax template called Sales Taxes and Charges Master, you have to go to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Setup &gt; Accounts &gt; Sales Taxes and Charge Master</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/sales-tax-master.png\" alt=\"Sales Tax Master\"></p>\n\n<p>When you create a new master, you will have to add a row for each tax type.</p>\n\n<p>The tax rate you define here will be the standard tax rate for all Items. If there are Items that have different rates, they must be added in the Item Tax table in the Item master.</p>\n\n<p>In each row, you have to mention:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Calculation Type: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>On Net Total : This can be on net total (total amount without taxes).</li>\n<li><p>On Previous Row Total/Amount: You can apply taxes on previous row total / amount. If you select this option, the tax will be applied as a percentage of the previous row (in the tax table) amount or total. Previous row amount means a particular tax amount.And, previous row total means net total plus taxes applied up to that row. In the Enter Row Field, mention row number on which you want to apply the current tax. If you want to apply the tax on the 3rd row, mention \"3\" in the Enter Row field.</p></li>\n<li><p>Actual : Enter as per actual amount in rate column.</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Account Head: The Account ledger under which this tax will be booked</p></li>\n<li>Cost Center: If the tax / charge is an income (like shipping) it needs to be booked against - a Cost Center.</li>\n<li>Description: Description of the tax (that will be printed in invoices / quotes).</li>\n<li>Rate: Tax rate.</li>\n<li>Amount: Tax amount.</li>\n<li>Total: Cumulative total to this point.</li>\n<li>Enter Row: If based on \"Previous Row Total\" you can select the row number which will be taken as a base for this calculation (default is the previous row).</li>\n<li>Is this Tax included in Basic Rate?: If you check this, it means that this tax will not be shown below the item table, but will be included in the rate in your main item table. This is useful when you want to give a flat price (inclusive of all taxes) to your customers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Once you setup your template, you can select this in your sales transactions.</p>\n\n<h2>Purchase Taxes and Charges Master</h2>\n\n<p>Similar to your Sales Taxes and Charges Master is the Purchase Taxes and Charges Master.</p>\n\n<p>This is the tax template that you can use in your Purchase Orders and Purchase Invoices.

Each Income / Expense entry is also tagged against a Cost Center. </p>\n\n<p>For example, if you have two types of sales:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Walk-in Sales</li>\n<li>Online Sales</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may not have shipping expenses for your walk-in customers, and no shop-rent for your online customers. If you want to get the profitability of each of these separately, you should create the two as Cost Centers and mark all sales as either \"Walk-in\" or \"Online\". Mark your all your purchases in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>Thus when you do your analysis you get a better understanding as to which side of your business is doing better. Since ERPNext has an option to add multiple Companies, you can create Cost Centers for each Company and manage it separately.</p>\n\n<p>To understand chart of cost centers in detail visit&nbsp;<a href=\"introduction-to-accounting\" target=\"_blank\">Accounting Knowledge.</a></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(31, 31, 33);   font-weight: bold; \">Chart of Cost Centers</span></p>\n\n<p>To setup your Chart of Cost Centers go to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Accounts &gt; Chart of Cost Centers</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/chart-of-cost-centers.png\" alt=\"Chart of Cost Center\"></p>\n\n<p>Cost centers help you in one more activity, budgeting.</p>\n\n<h3>Budgeting</h3>\n\n<p>ERPNext will help you set and manage budgets on your Cost Centers. This is useful when, for example, you are doing online sales. You have a budget for search ads, and you want ERPNext to stop or warn you from over spending, based on that budget. </p>\n\n<p>Budgets are also great for planning purposes. When you are making plans for the next financial year, you would typically target a revenue based on which you would set your expenses. Setting a budget will ensure that your expenses do not get out of hand, at any point, as per your plans.</p>\n\n<p>You can define it in the Cost Center. If you have seasonal sales you can also define a budget distribution that the budget will follow.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Accounts &gt; Budget Distribution &gt; New Budget Distribution</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/budgeting.png\" alt=\"Budget Distribution\"></p>\n\n<p>\ufffc</p>\n\n<h4>Budget Actions</h4>\n\n<p>ERPNext allows you to either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stop.</li>\n<li>Warn or, </li>\n<li>Ignore </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>if you exceed budgets. </p>\n\n<p>These can be defined from the Company record.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you choose to \u201cignore\u201d budget overruns, you will get a wealth of information from the \u201cBudget vs Actual\u201d variance report.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note: When you set a budget, it has to be set as per Account under the Cost Center. For example if you have a Cost Center \u201cOnline Sales\u201d, you can restrict \u201cAdvertising Budget\u201d by creating a row with that Account and defining the amount.\f</p>\n</blockquote>",

   "main_section": "\n\t<p>The Chart of Accounts forms the blueprint of your organization. The overall structure of your Chart of Accounts is based on a system of double entry accounting that has become a standard all over the world to quantify how a company is doing financially. </p>\n\n<p>The Chart of Accounts helps you to answer:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What is your organisation worth?</li>\n<li>How much debt have you taken?</li>\n<li>How much profit are you making (and hence paying tax)?</li>\n<li>How much are you selling?</li>\n<li><p>What is your expense break-up</p>\n\n<p>You may note that as a business manager,it is very valuable to see how well your business is doing. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tip: If you can\u2019t read a Balance Sheet (I confess it took me a long time to figure this out) it's a good opportunity to start learning about this. It will be worth the effort. You can also take the help of your accountant to setup your Chart of Accounts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Financial statement of your company is easily viewable in ERPNext. An Example of a financial statement is given below:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/financial-analytic-bs.png\" alt=\"Financial Analytics Balance Sheet\"></p>\n\n<p>To edit your Chart of Accounts in ERPNext go to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <br><a href=\"accounts\" target=\"_blank\">Accounts&nbsp;</a><span>&gt; Chart of Accounts</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Chart of Accounts is a tree view of the names of the Accounts  (Ledgers and Groups) that a Company requires to manage its books of accounts. ERPNext sets up a simple chart of accounts for each Company you create, but you have to modify it according to your needs and legal requirements.\n\ufffc\nFor each company, Chart of Accounts signifies the way to classify the accounting entries, mostly based on statutory (tax, compliance to government regulations) requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Let us understand the main groups of the Chart of Accounts.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/chart-of-accounts.png\" alt=\"Chart of Accounts: Root Accounts\"></p>\n\n<h3>Balance Sheet Accounts</h3>\n\n<p>The Balance Sheet has Application of Funds (Assets) and Sources of Funds (Liabilities) that signify the net-worth of your company at any given time. When you begin or end a financial period, all the Assets are equal to the Liabilities.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Accounting: If you are new to accounting, you might be wondering, how can Assets be equal to Liabilities? That would mean the company has nothing of its own. Thats right. All the \u201cinvestment\u201d made in the company to buy assets (like land, furniture, machines) is made by the owners and is a liability to the company. If the company would want to shut down, it would need to sell all the assets and pay back all the liabilities (including profits) to the owners, leaving itself with nothing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All the accounts under this represent an asset owned by the company like \"Bank Account\", \"Land and Property\", \"Furniture\" or a liability (funds that the company owes to others) like \"Owners funds\", \"Debt\" etc.</p>\n\n<p>Two special accounts to note here are Accounts Receivable (money you have to collect from your customers) and Accounts Payable (money you have to pay to your suppliers) under Assets and Liabilities respectively.</p>\n\n<h3>Profit and Loss Accounts</h3>\n\n<p>Profit and Loss is the group of Income and Expense accounts that represent your accounting transactions over a period.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike Balance sheet accounts, Profit and Loss accounts (or PL accounts) do not represent net worth (assets), but rather represent the amount of money spent and collected in servicing customers during the period. Hence at the beginning and end of your Fiscal Year, they become zero.</p>\n\n<p>In ERPNext it is easy to create a Profit and Loss analysis chart. An example of a Profit and Loss analysis chart is given below:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/financial-analytic-pl.png\" alt=\"Financial Analytics Profit and Loss\"></p>\n\n<p>(On the first day of the year you have not made any profit or loss, but you still have assets, hence balance sheet accounts never become zero at the beginning or end of a period)</p>\n\n<h3>Groups and Ledgers</h3>\n\n<p>There are two main kinds of Accounts in ERPNext - Group and Ledger. Groups can have sub-groups and ledgers within them, whereas ledgers are the leaf nodes of your chart and cannot be further classified.</p>\n\n<p>Accounting Transactions can only be made against Ledger Accounts (not Groups)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Info: The term \"Ledger\" means a page in an accounting book where entries are made. There is usually one ledger for each account (like a Customer or a Supplier).</p>\n  \n  <p>Note: An Account \u201cLedger\u201d is also sometimes called as Account \u201cHead\u201d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/chart-of-accounts-1.png\" alt=\"Chart of Accounts: Groups and Ledger\"></p>\n\n<h3>Other Account Types</h3>\n\n<p>In ERPNext, you can also specify more information when you create a new Account, this is there to help you select that particular account in a scenario like Bank Account or a Tax Account and has no effect on the Chart itself.</p>\n\n<p>You can also tag if an account represents a Customer, Supplier or Employee in \"Master Type\".</p>\n\n<h3>Creating / Editing Accounts</h3>\n\n<p>To create new Accounts, explore your Chart of Accounts and click on an Account group under which you want to create the new Account. On the right side, you will see an option to \u201cEdit\u201d or \u201cAdd\u201d a new Account.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/chart-of-accounts-2.png\" alt=\"Chart of Accounts: New Account\"></p>\n\n<p>Option to create will only appear if you click on a Group (folder) type Account.</p>\n\n<p>ERPNext creates a standard structure for you when the Company is created but it is up to you to modify or add or remove accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, you might want to create Accounts for</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Types of Expenses (travel, salaries, telephone etc) under Expenses.</li>\n<li>Taxes (VAT, Sales Tax etc based on your country) under Current Liabilities.</li>\n<li>Types of Sales (for example, Product Sales, Service Sales etc.) under Income.</li>\n<li>Types of Assets (building, machinery, furniture etc.) under Fixed Assets.</li>\n</ul>",

   "main_section": "\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t<p>An Item is your company's product or a service.The term Item is applicable to your core products as well as your raw materials. It can be a product or service that you buy/sell from your customers/ suppliers. ERPNext allows you to manage all sorts of items like raw-materials, sub-assemblies, finished goods, item variants and service items. </p>\n\n<p>ERPNext is optimized for itemized management of your sales and purchase. If you are in services, you can create an Item for each services that your offer. Completing the Item Master is very essential for successful implementation of ERPNext.</p>\n\n<h2>Item Properties</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Item Name:</strong> Item name is the actual name of your product or service.</li>\n<li><strong>Item Code:</strong> Item Code is a short-form to denote your Item. If you have very few Items, it is advisable to keep the Item Name and the Item Code same. This helps new users to recognise and update Item details in all transactions. In case you have lot of Items with long names and the list runs in hundreds, it is advisable to code. To understand naming Item codes see&nbsp;<a href=\"item-codification\" target=\"_blank\">Item Codification</a></li>\n<li><strong>Item Group:</strong> Item Group is used to categorize an Item under various criterias like products, raw materials, services, sub-assemblies, consumables or all Item groups. Create your default Item Group list under Setup&gt; Item Group and pre-select the option while filling your New Item details under&nbsp;<a href=\"http://erpnext.org/item-group\" target=\"_blank\">Item Group</a></li>\n<li><strong>Default Unit of Measure:</strong> This is the default measuring unit that you will use for your product. It could be in nos, kgs, meters, etc. You can store all the UOM\u2019s that your product will require under Set Up&gt; Master Data &gt; UOM. These can be preselected while filling New Item by using % sign to get a pop up of the UOM list. </li>\n<li><strong>Brand:</strong> If you have more than one brand save them under Set Up&gt; Master Data&gt; Brand and pre-select them while filling a New Item.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/item-properties.png\" alt=\"Item Properties\"></p>\n\n<h3>Upload an Image</h3>\n\n<p>To  upload an image for your icon that will appear in all transactions, save the partially filled form. Only after your file is saved a \u201c+\u201d button will appear besides the Image icon. Click on this sign and upload the image.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/item-add-image.png\" alt=\"Item Properties\"></p>\n\n<h3>Inventory : Warehouse and Stock Setting</h3>\n\n<p>In ERPNext, you can select  different type of Warehouses to stock your different Items. This can be selected based on Item types. It could be Fixed Asset Item, Stock Item or even Manufacturing Item. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stock Item:</strong> If you are maintaining stock of this Item in your Inventory, ERPNext will make a stock ledger entry for each transaction of this item.</li>\n<li><strong>Default Warehouse:</strong> This is the Warehouse that is automatically selected in your transactions. </li>\n<li><strong>Allowance Percentage:</strong> This is the  percent by which you will be allowed to over-bill or  over-deliver this Item. If not set, it will select from  the Global Defaults. </li>\n<li><strong>Valuation Method:</strong> There are two options to maintain valuation of stock. FIFO (first in -  first out) and Moving Average. To understand this topic in detail please visit \u201c Item Valuation, FIFO and Moving Average\u201d.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Serialized and Batched Inventory</h3>\n\n<p>These numbers help to track individual units or batches of Items which you sell. It also tracks warranty and returns. In case any individual Item is recalled by the supplier the number system helps to track individual Item. The numbering system  also manages expiry dates. Please note that if you sell your items in thousands, and if the items are very small like pens or erasers, you need not serialize them. In ERPNext, you will have to mention the serial number in some accounting entries. To create serial numbers you will have to manually create all the numbers in your entries. If your product is not a big consumer durable Item, if it has no warranty and has no chances of being recalled, avoid giving serial numbers. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Important: Once you mark an item as serialized or batched or neither, you cannot change it after you have made any stock entry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://erpnext.org/serialized-inventory\" target=\"_blank\">Discussion on Serialized Inventory</a><br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Re Ordering</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Re-order level</strong> suggests the amount of stock balance in the Warehouse. </li>\n<li><strong>Re-order Qty</strong> suggests the amount of stock to be ordered  to maintain minimum stock levels.</li>\n<li><strong>Minimum Order Qty</strong> is the minimum quantity for which a Material Request / Purchase Order must be made.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Item Tax</h3>\n\n<p>These settings are required only if a particular Item has a different tax rate than the rate defined in the standard tax Account. For example,  If you have a tax Account, \u201cVAT 10%\u201d and this particular Item is exempted from tax, then you select \u201cVAT 10%\u201d in the first column, and set \u201c0\u201d as the tax rate in the second column. </p>\n\n<p>Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"setting-up-taxes\" target=\"_blank\">Setting Up Taxes</a>&nbsp;to understand this topic in detail.</p>\n\n<h3>Inspection</h3>\n\n<p>Inspection Required: If an incoming inspection (at the time of delivery from the Supplier) is mandatory for this Item, mention \u201cInspection Required\u201d as \u201cYes\u201d. The system will ensure that a Quality Inspection will be prepared and approved before a Purchase     Receipt is submitted.</p>\n\n<p>Inspection Criteria: If a Quality Inspection is prepared for this Item, then this template of criteria will automatically be updated in the Quality Inspection table of the Quality Inspection. Examples of Criteria are: Weight, Length, Finish etc.</p>\n\n<h3>Purchase Details</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/item-purchase.png\" alt=\"Purchase Details\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Lead time days:</strong> Lead time days are the number of days required for the Item to reach the warehouse.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Default Expense Account:</strong> It is the account in which cost of the Item will be debited.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Default Cost Centre:</strong> It is used for tracking expense for this Item.</p>\n\n<h3>Sales Details</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/item-sales.png\" alt=\"Sales Details\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Default Income Account:</strong>  Income account selected here will be fetched automatically in sales invoice for this item.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cost Centre:</strong> Cost center selected here will be fetched automatically in sales invoice for this item.</p>\n\n<h3>Manufacturing And Website</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/item-manufacturing-website.png\" alt=\"Manufacturing\"></p>\n\n<p>Visit&nbsp;<a href=\"manufacturing\" target=\"_blank\">Manufacturing</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"setting-up-your-website-webshop\" target=\"_blank\">Website&nbsp;</a>to understand these topics in detail.</p>\n\n<p>To list your products on the website and understand this process in detail, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"http://erpnext.org/product-listing-on-website\" target=\"_blank\">Product Listing On Website</a></p>",

   "main_section": "\n\t\n\t<p>The value of available inventory is treated as an Asset in company's Chart of Accounts. Depending on the type of items, it can be treated as Fixed Asset or Current Asset. To prepare Balance Sheet, you should make the accounting entries for those assets. \nThere are generally two different methods of accounting for inventory:</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Auto / Perpetual Inventory</strong></h3>\n\n<p>In this process, for each stock transactions, the system posts relevant accounting entries to sync stock balance and accounting balance. This is the default setting in ERPNext for new accounts.</p>\n\n<p>When you buy and receive items, those items are booked as the company\u2019s assets (stock-in-hand / fixed-assets). When you sell and deliver those items, an expense (cost-of-goods-sold) equal to the buying cost of the items is booked. General Ledger entries are made after every stock transaction.  As a result, the value as per Stock Ledger always remains same with the relevant account balance. This improves accuracy of Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss statement.</p>\n\n<p>To check accounting entries for a particular stock transaction, please check <strong><a href=\"perpetual-inventory\">examples</a></strong></p>\n\n<h4><strong>Advantages</strong></h4>\n\n<p>Perpetual Inventory system will make it easier for you to maintain accuracy of company's asset and expense values. Stock balances will always be synced with relevant account balances, so no more periodic manual entry has to be done to balance them.</p>\n\n<p>In case of new back-dated stock transactions or cancellation/amendment of an existing transaction, all the future Stock Ledger entries and GL Entries will be recalculated for all items of that transaction.\nThe same is applicable if any cost is added to the submitted Purchase Receipt, later through the Landed Cost Wizard.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note: Perpetual Inventory totally depends upon the item valuation rate. Hence, you have to be more careful entering valuation rate while making any incoming stock transactions like Purchase Receipt, Material Receipt, or Manufacturing / Repack.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3><strong>Periodic Inventory</strong></h3>\n\n<p>In this method, accounting entries are manually created periodically, to sync stock balance and relevant account balance. The system does not create accounting entries automatically for assets, at the time of material purchases or sales.</p>\n\n<p>In an accounting period, when you buy and receive items, an expense is booked in your accounting system. You sell and deliver some of these items.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of an accounting period, the total value of items to be sold, need to be booked as the company\u2019s assets, often known as stock-in-hand. </p>\n\n<p>The difference between the value of the items remaining to be sold and the previous period\u2019s stock-in-hand value can be positive or negative. If positive, this value is removed from expenses (cost-of-goods-sold) and is added to assets (stock-in-hand / fixed-assets). If negative, a reverse entry is passed. </p>\n\n<p>This complete process is called Periodic Inventory.</p>\n\n<p>If you are an existing user using Periodic Inventory and want to use Perpetual Inventory, you have to follow some steps to migrate. For details, check&nbsp;<a href=\"http://erpnext.org/migrate-to-perpetual-inventory\" target=\"_blank\">Migration From Periodic Inventory</a>.</p>",

   "main_section": "<p>The Manufacturing module in ERPNext helps you to maintain multi-level Bill of Materials (BOMs) for your Items. It helps you in Product Costing, planing your production via Production Plan, creating Production Orders for your manufacturing shop floors and planing your inventory by getting your material requirement via BOMs (also called Material Requirements Planning MRP).</p><h3 style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Types of Production Planning</h3><p>Broadly there are three types of Production Planning Systems</p><ul><li>Make-to-Stock: In these systems, production is planned based on a forecast and the Items are then sold to distributors or customers. All fast moving consumer goods that are sold in retail shops like soaps, packaged water etc and electronics like phones etc are Made to Stock.</li><li>Make-to-Order: In these systems, manufacturing takes place after a firm order is placed by a Customer.</li><li>Engineer-to-Order: In this case each sale is a separate Project and has to be designed and engineered to the requirements of the Customer. Common examples of this are any custom business like furniture, machine tools, speciality devices, metal fabrication etc.</li></ul><p>Most small and medium sized manufacturing businesses are based on a make-to-order or engineer-to-order system and so is ERPNext.</p><p>For engineer-to-order systems, the Manufacturing module should be used along with the Projects module.</p><h4 style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Manufacturing and Inventory</h4><p>\ufffc You can track work-in-progress by creating work-in-progress Warehouses.</p><p>ERPNext will help you track material movement by automatically creating Stock Entries from your Production Orders by building from Bill of Materials.</p><hr><h3 style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Material Requirements Planning (MRP):</h3><p>The earliest ERP systems were made for manufacturing. The earliest adopters were automobile companies who had thousands of raw materials and sub-assemblies and found it very hard to keep track of requirements and plan purchases. They started using computers to build the material requirements from forecasts and Bill of Materials.</p><p>Later these systems were expanded to include Finances, Payroll, Order Processing, and Purchasing and thus became the more generic Enterprise Resource Systems (ERP). More recently Customer Relationship Management (CRM) was added as a function and is now an integral part of ERP systems.</p><p>These days the term ERP is used to describe systems that help manage any kind of organization like education institutes (Education ERP) or Hospitals (Hospital ERP) and so on.</p><hr><h3 style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Best Practice: Lean Manufacturing</h3><p>The state of art manufacturing philosophy (the rationale behind the planning processes) comes from Japanese auto major Toyota. At the time when American manufacturers depended on MRP systems to plan their manufacturing based on their sales forecasts, they turned around the problem by discovering a leaner way of planning their production. They realized that:</p><p>The biggest cause of wastage in manufacturing is variation (in product and quantity).</p><p>So they standardized their products and sub-assemblies and sold fixed quantities based on what they produced or did not produce based on what they sold. This way, they had an extremely predictable and stable product mix. If they sold less than planned, they would simply stop production.</p><p>Their card signaling system kanban, would notify all their suppliers to stop production too. Hence they never used any of the complex material planning tools like MRP to play day-to-day material requirements, but a simple signaling system that said either STOP or GO.</p><p>They combined this system with neatly managed factories with well labeled racks.</p><p>Small manufacturing companies are usually make-to-order or engineer-to-order and can hardly afford to have a high level of standardization. Thus small manufacturing businesses should aim for repeatability by innovating processes and creating a common platform for products.</p>",

Some complications arise when:</p><ul><li>Back-dated (past) entries are made / edited: This affects future stock levels and may lead to negative stock.</li><li>Stock has to be valued based on First-in-First-out: ERPNext needs to maintain a sequence of all transactions to know the exact value of your Items.</li><li>Stock reports are required at any point in time in the past: You have to lookup what was the quantity / value your stock of Item X on date Y.</li></ul><p>To manage this, ERPNext collects all inventory transactions in a table called the Stock Ledger Entry.

You may have an accountant in your team, or you may be doing accounting yourself or you may have outsourced your accounting. Financial accounting forms the core of any business management system like an ERP.</p><p>In ERPNext, your accounting operations consists of 3 main transactions:</p><ul><li>Sales Invoice: The bills that you raise to your Customers for the products or services you provide.\u2028</li><li>Purchase Invoice: Bills that your Suppliers give you for their products or services.\u2028</li><li>Journal Vouchers: For accounting entries, like payments, credit and other types.</li></ul><hr><h3 style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Accounting Basics</h3><h4 style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Debit and Credit</h4><p>People new to accounting are often confused with the terms Debit and Credit. Contrary to their meaning, these terms have nothing to do with who owes what.</p><p>Debit and Credit are conventions. All accounting follows these so that it is easy to understand the state of finances in a universal manner. These conventions are:</p><ul><li>All Accounts are of type Debit or Credit.</li><li>Assets and Expenses (and their sub-groups) are always Debit.</li><li>Liabilities and Income (and their sub-groups) are always Credit.</li><li>In all accounting entries, you \u201cdebit\u201d an Account or \u201ccredit\u201d one.</li><li>When you \u201cdebit\u201d an Debit Account (an asset or expense), its value increases (\u201cadd\u201d operation). When you \u201ccredit\u201d a Debit Account, its value decreases (\u201csubtract\u201d operation). The same rule applies for Credit Accounts. \u201cCrediting\u201d a Credit Account, increases its value, \u201cdebiting\u201d it decreases its value.</li><li>All accounting transactions (like a sales or a payment) must affect at least two different Accounts and sum of debits must be equal to sum of credits for the transaction. This is called the \u201cdouble-entry bookkeeping system\u201d.</li></ul><p>Still confused? These conventions will become clearer as you make transactions.</p><h4 style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Accrual System</h4><p>Another important concept to understand in Accounting is accrual. This is important when your payment happens separately from delivery.</p><p>For example you buy X from a Supplier and your Supplier sends you a bill and expects you to pay in, for example, seven days. Even if you have not yet paid your Supplier, your expense must be booked immediately. This expense is booked against a group of Accounts called \u201cAccounts Payable\u201d that is the sum of all your outstanding dues to your Suppliers. This is called accrual. When you pay your Supplier, you will cancel his dues and update your bank account.</p><p>ERPNext works on an accrual system. The transactions that accrue income and expense are Sales Invoice and Purchase Invoice.</p><p>In retail, typically, delivery and payment happens at the same time. To cover this scenario, we have in ERPNext a POS Invoice (POS = Point of Sales). More on that later.</p>",

There are two types of accounts: Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Statement accounts. Balance Sheet consists of Assets and Liabilities accounts and Profit and Loss Statement accounts consists of Incomes and Expenses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assets:</strong> Bank and Cash balances, outstanding amounts of customers and all other assets are recorded here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Liabilities:</strong> All the company's liabilities like shareholder's capital, outstanding amount to be paid to suppliers, taxes to be paid to concerned to authorities are recorded under this group.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Income:</strong> Income from direct/indirect sales.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Expenses:</strong> All the expenses to run the business, like salaries, purchases, rent etc. are recorded here.</p>\n\n<h3>Debit and Credit</h3>\n\n<p>Each of these accounts are either \"Debit\" or \"Credit\" type. Assets, Expenses are \"Debit\" accounts and Liabilities, Incomes are \"Credit\" accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Accounting Entries</p>\n\n<p>The balance of account can be increased / decreased, depending on account type and transaction type.</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered text-center\">\n    <thead>\n        <tr class=\"active\">\n            <td>Account Type</td>\n            <td>Transaction Type</td>\n            <td>Effect on account balance</td>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Debit</td>\n            <td>Debit</td>\n            <td>Increases</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Debit</td>\n            <td>Credit</td>\n            <td>Decreases</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Credit</td>\n            <td>Credit</td>\n            <td>Increases</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Credit</td>\n            <td>Debit</td>\n            <td>Decreases</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Double Entry</h3>\n\n<p>This means that every accounting entry has two parts, one debit and one credit and must affect two separate accounts.

See the example below:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Company sells a laptop worth 50000 to Customer A and delivers that with an invoice.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As the company will receive a payment from customer, the customer is considered as an asset account. For booking income, company maintains an account called \"Sales of Laptop\".

You are already using a software like Accounting, and may be some more to manage your inventory and sales (or CRM). </p>\n\n<p>An ERP brings all of this together in one place.</p>\n\n<p>Small businesses are not so different from large ones. They contain most of the complexities of a large business along with many other constraints. Small businesses have to communicate with customers, do accounts, pay taxes, do payroll, manage timelines, deliver quality, answer questions, and keep everyone happy just like in large businesses.</p>\n\n<p>Large businesses have the advantage of using advanced data systems to manage their process efficiently. Small businesses, on the other hand, typically struggle to keep things organized. They often use a mix of apps like spreadsheets, accounting software, web CRM etc to manage.The problem is, not everyone is on the same page. An ERP changes that.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>What is ERPNext?</h2>\n\n<p>ERPNext helps you to manage all your business information in one application and use it to manage operations and take decisions based on data.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/erpnext-introduction.png\" alt=\"ERPNext-Introduction\"></p>\n\n<p>Among other things, ERPNext will help you to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Track all Invoices and Payments.</li>\n<li>Know what quantity of which product is available in stock.</li>\n<li>Identify open customer queries.</li>\n<li>Manage payroll.</li>\n<li>Assign tasks and follow up on them.</li>\n<li>Maintain a database of all your customers, suppliers and their contacts.</li>\n<li>Prepare quotes.</li>\n<li>Get reminders on maintenance schedules.</li>\n<li>Publish your website.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And a lot lot lot more.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Why Should I Use ERPNext?</h2>\n\n<p>ERPNext is a modern tool that covers not only accounting but also all other business functions, on an integrated platform. It has many benefits over both traditional accounting as well as ERP applications.</p>\n\n<h3>Benefits over traditional accounting software:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do a lot more than just accounting! Manage inventory, billing, quotes, leads, payroll and a lot more.</li>\n<li>Keep all your data safe and in one place. Don\u2019t keep hunting for data when you need it across spreadsheets and different computers.\n-Manage everyone on the same page. All users get the same updated data.</li>\n<li>Stop repetitive work. Don\u2019t enter the same information from your word processor to your accounting tool. It's all integrated.</li>\n<li>Keep track. Get the entire history of a customer or a deal in one place.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Benefits over big ERPs</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$$$ - Saves money.</li>\n<li><strong>Easier to configure:</strong> Big ERPs are notoriously hard to setup and will ask you a zillion questions before you can do something meaningful.</li>\n<li><strong>Easier to use:</strong> Modern web like user interface will keep your users happy and in familiar territory.</li>\n<li><strong>Open Source :</strong> This software is always free and you can host it anywhere you like.</li>\n</ul>",

To add images to your Quotations, attach the corresponding image in the Item master.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Rates</h3>\n\n<p>The rates you quote may depend on two things.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Price List: If you have multiple Price Lists, you can select a Price List or tag it to the Customer (so that it is auto-selected). Your Item prices will automatically be updated from the Price List.For details refer&nbsp;<a href=\"http://erpnext.org/price-lists\" target=\"_blank\">Price List</a></p></li>\n<li><p>The Currency: If you are quoting to a Customer in a different currency, you will have to update the conversion rates to enable ERPNext to save the information in your standard Currency. This will help you to analyze the value of your Quotations in standard Currency.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Taxes</h3>\n\n<p>To add taxes to your Quotation, you can either select a tax template, Sales Taxes and Charges Master or add the taxes on your own. To understand taxes in detail visit&nbsp;<a href=\"http://erpnext.org/setting-up-taxes\" target=\"_blank\">Taxes</a></p>\n\n<p>You can add taxes in the same manner as the Sales Taxes and Charges Master.</p>\n\n<h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>\n\n<p>Each Quotation must ideally contain a set of terms, of your contract. It is usually a good idea to make templates of your Terms and Conditions, so that you have a standard set of terms. \nYou can do this by going to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Selling &gt; Terms and Conditions  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>What should Terms and Conditions Contain?</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Validity of the offer.</li>\n<li>Payment Terms (In Advance, On Credit, part advance etc).</li>\n<li>What is extra (or payable by the Customer).</li>\n<li>Safety / usage warning.</li>\n<li>Warranty if any.</li>\n<li>Returns Policy.</li>\n<li>Terms of shipping, if applicable.</li>\n<li>Ways of addressing disputes, indemnity, liability, etc.</li>\n<li>Address and Contact of your Company.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Submission</h3>\n\n<p>Quotation is a \u201cSubmittable\u201d transaction. Since you send this Quotation to your Customer or Lead, you must freeze it so that changes are not made after you send the Quotation.  See Document Stages.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tip: Quotations can also be titled as \u201cProforma Invoice\u201d or \u201cProposal\u201d. Select the right heading in the \u201cPrint Heading\u201d field in the \u201cMore Info\u201d section. To create new Print Headings go to Setup &gt; Branding and Printing &gt; Print Headings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Discount</h3>\n\n<p>While making your sales transactions like a Quotation (or Sales Order) you would already have noticed that there is a \u201cDiscount\u201d column. On the left is the \u201cPrice List Rate\u201d on the right is the \u201cBasic Rate\u201d.  You can add a \u201cDiscount\u201d value to update the basic rate.

   "main_section": "\n\t<p>As we discussed in the <strong>Item</strong> section, if an <strong>Item</strong> is <em>serialized</em>, a <strong>Serial Number</strong> (Serial No) record is maintained for each quantity of that <strong>Item</strong>. This information is helpful in tracking the location of the Serial No, its warranty and end-of-life (expiry) information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Serial Nos</strong> are also useful to maintain fixed assets. <strong>Maintenance Schedules</strong> can also be created against serial numbers for planning and scheduling maintenance activity for these assets (if they require maintenance).</p>\n\n<p>You can also track from which <strong>Supplier</strong> you purchased the <strong>Serial No</strong> and to which <strong>Customer</strong> you have sold it. The <strong>Serial No</strong> status will tell you its current inventory status.</p>\n\n<p>If your Item is <em>serialized</em> you will have to enter the Serial Nos in the related column with each Serial No in a new line.</p>\n\n<h3>Serial Nos and Inventory</h3>\n\n<p>Inventory of an Item can only be affected if the Serial No is transacted via a Stock transaction (Stock Entry, Purchase Receipt, Delivery Note, Sales Invoice). When a new Serial No is created directly, its warehouse cannot be set.</p>\n\n<h3>Using Serial Nos</h3>\n\n<p>To add a Serial No to a stock transaction, you can set the Serial No in the serial no field:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/serial-no-entry.png\" alt=\"Serial No Entry\"></p>\n\n<h3>Creation</h3>\n\n<p>Serial Nos can automatically be created from a Stock Entry or Purchase Receipt. If you mention Serial No in the Serial Nos column, it will automatically create those serial Nos.</p>\n\n<h3>Automatic Series</h3>\n\n<p>If in the Item Master, the Serial No Series is mentioned, you can leave the Serial No column blank in a Stock Entry / Purchase Receipt and Serial Nos will automatically be set from that series.</p>\n\n<h4>Step 1: Mention the Series in the Item</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/item-serial-no-series.png\" alt=\"Automatic Series\"></p>\n\n<h4>Step 2: Keep Serial No field blank in your entry</h4>\n\n<h4>Step 3: Save / Submit your transaction (Serial Nos Automatically Updated)</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/serial-no-auto-1.png\" alt=\"Serial No Created Message\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/serial-no-auto-2.png\" alt=\"Serial No Updated in Transaction\"></p>\n\n<h3><span>Using Serial Numbers for Multiple Purposes</span><br></h3>\n\n<p>Serial Nos are a useful tool for tracking different kinds of Items, by using it along with Custom Fields. For example, in our internal system at Web Notes, each ERP account is a Serial No, with type of user \u201cPlan\u201d as the Item, its expiry date, whether it is Trial or Paid and other details as Custom Fields.</p>\n\n<p>We have known customers who use Serial Nos to track fixed assets, real-estate properties or advertisement slots, even library books!</p>\n\n<p>Since Serial Nos are deeply linked with all the core modules, Selling, Buying, Inventory and Accounting, you may find many uses for them.\f</p>",

Create one Item as Wheat with UOM KG. In this case mention only the source warehouse. Create another Item as Wheat Bag and mention UOM as Nos. Mention Target Warehouse for Wheat Bags. Mention Valuation numbers, save and submit the entry.</p>\n\n<p>The stock will be calculated as per the entry and will reflect in the stock report.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/repack-2.png\" alt=\"Repack\" /></p>\n",

DocTypes contain a collection of fields called DocFields that form the basis of the columns in the database and the layout of the form.</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered text-left\">\n    <thead>\n        <tr class=\"active\">\n            <td width=\"30%\">Column</td>\n            <td>Description</td>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Name</td>\n            <td>Name of the record</td>\n\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Owner</td>\n            <td>Creator and Owner of the record</td>\n\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Created on</td>\n            <td>Date and Time of Creation</td>\n\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Modified On </td>\n            <td>Date and Time of Modification</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Docstatus</td>\n            <td>Status of the record<br>\n                0 = Saved/Draft<br>\n                1 = Submitted<br>\n                2 = Cancelled/Deleted\n            </td> \n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Parent</td>\n            <td>Name of the Parent</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Parent Type</td>\n            <td>Type of Parent</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Parent Field</td>\n            <td>Specifying the relationship with the parent (there can be multiple child relationships with the same DocType).</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Index(idx)</td>\n            <td>Index (sequence) of the record in the child table.</td>\n\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Single DocType</h4>\n\n<p>There are a certain type of DocTypes that are \u201cSingle\u201d, i.e. they have no table associated and have only one record of its fields. DocTypes such as Global Defaults, Production Planning Tool are \u201cSingle\u201d DocTypes.</p>\n",

   "main_section": "<p>Before you start implementation, lets get familiar with the terminology that is used and some basic concepts in ERPNext.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Basic Concepts</h3>\n\n<h4>Company</h4>\n\n<p>This represents the Company records for which ERPNext is setup. With this same setup, you can create multiple Company records, each representing a different legal entity. The accounting for each Company will be different, but they will share the Customer, Supplier and Item records.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Setup &gt; Company </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Customer</h4>\n\n<p>Represents a customer. A Customer can be an individual or an organizations. You can create multiple Contacts and Addresses for each Customer.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Selling &gt; Customer</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Supplier</h4>\n\n<p>Represents a supplier of goods or services. Your telephone company is a Supplier, so is your raw materials Supplier. Again, a Supplier can be an individual or an organization and has multiple Contacts and Addresses.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Buying &gt; Supplier</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Item</h4>\n\n<p>A Product, sub-product or Service that is either bought, sold or manufactured and is uniquely identified.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Stock &gt; Item</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Account</h4>\n\n<p>An Account is a heading under which financial and business transactions are carried on. For example, \u201cTravel Expense\u201d is an account, \u201cCustomer Zoe\u201d, \u201cSupplier Mae\u201d are accounts. ERPNext creates accounts for Customers and Suppliers automatically.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Accounts &gt; Chart of Accounts</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Address</h4>\n\n<p>An address represents location details of a Customer or Supplier. These can be of different locations such as Head Office, Factory, Warehouse, Shop etc. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Selling &gt; Address</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Contact</h4>\n\n<p>An individual Contact belongs to a Customer or Supplier or is just an independent. A Contact has a name and contact details like email and phone number.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Selling &gt; Contact</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Communication</h4>\n\n<p>A list of all Communication with a Contact or Lead. All emails sent from the system are added to the Communication table.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Support &gt; Communication</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Price List</h4>\n\n<p>A Price List is a place where different rate plans can be stored. It\u2019s a name you give to a set of Item Prices stored under a particular List.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Selling &gt; Price List</p>\n  \n  <p>Buying &gt; Price List</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Accounting</h3>\n\n<h4>Fiscal Year</h4>\n\n<p>Represents a Financial Year or Accounting Year. You can operate multiple Fiscal Years at the same time. Each Fiscal Year has a start date and an end date and transactions can only be recorded in this period. When you \u201cclose\u201d a fiscal year, it's balances are transferred as \u201copening\u201d balances for the next fiscal year.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Setup &gt; Company &gt; Fiscal Year</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Cost Center</h4>\n\n<p>A Cost Center is like an Account, but the only difference is that its structure represents your business more closely than Accounts. For example in your Chart of Accounts, you separate your expenses by type (say travel, marketing etc). In your Chart of Cost Centers, you can separate them by product line or business group (for example online sales, retail sales)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Accounts &gt; Chart of Cost Centers</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Journal Voucher</h4>\n\n<p>A document that contains General Ledger (GL) entries and the sum of Debits and Credits of those entries is the same. In ERPNext you can update Payments, Returns etc using Journal Vouchers.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Accounts &gt; Journal Voucher</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Sales Invoice</h4>\n\n<p>A bill sent to Customers for delivery of Items (goods or services).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Accounts &gt; Sales Invoice</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Purchase Invoice</h4>\n\n<p>A bill sent by a Supplier for delivery of Items (goods or services).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Accounts &gt; Purchase Invoice</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Currency</h4>\n\n<p>ERPNext allows you to book transactions in multiple currencies. There is only one currency for your book of accounts though. While posting your Invoices, payments in different currencies, the amount is converted to the default currency by the specified conversion rate.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Setup &gt; Currency</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Selling</h3>\n\n<h4>Customer Group</h4>\n\n<p>A classification of Customers, usually based on market segment.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Selling &gt; Setup &gt; Customer Group</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Lead</h4>\n\n<p>A person who could be a future source of business.

Deliveries, Production Orders and Invoices are made on basis of Sales Orders.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Selling &gt; Sales Order</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Territory</h4>\n\n<p>A geographical area classification for sales management. You can set targets for Territories and each sale is linked to a Territory.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Selling &gt; Setup &gt; Territory</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Sales Partner</h4>\n\n<p>A third party distributer / dealer / affiliate / commission agent who sells the company\u2019s products usually for a commission.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Selling &gt; Setup &gt; Sales Partner</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Sales Person</h4>\n\n<p>Someone who pitches to the Customer and closes deals. You can set targets for Sales Persons and tag them in transactions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Selling &gt; Setup &gt; Sales Person</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Buying</h3>\n\n<h4>Purchase Order</h4>\n\n<p>A contract given to a Supplier to deliver the specified Items at the specified cost, quantity, dates and other terms.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Buying &gt; Purchase Order</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Material Request</h4>\n\n<p>A request made by a system User, or automatically generated by ERPNext based on reorder level or projected quantity in Production Plan for purchasing a set of Items.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Buying &gt; Material Request</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Stock (Inventory)</h3>\n\n<h4>Warehouse</h4>\n\n<p>A logical Warehouse against which stock entries are made.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Stock &gt; Warehouse</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Stock Entry</h4>\n\n<p>Material transfer from a Warehouse, to a Warehouse or from one Warehouse to another.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Stock &gt; Stock Entry</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Delivery Note</h4>\n\n<p>A list of Items with quantities for shipment.

   "main_section": "<p>Support Ticket is an incoming query from your Customer, usually via email or from the \u201cContact\u201d section of your website. (To fully integrate the Support Ticket to email, see the Email Settings section). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tip: A dedicated support email id is a good way to integrate incoming queries via email. For example, you can send support queries to ERPNext at support@erpnext.com and it will automatically create a Support Ticket in the Web Notes system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Support &gt; Support Ticket &gt; New Support Ticket</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/support-ticket.png\" alt=\"Support Ticket\" /></p>\n\n<h4>Discussion Thread</h4>\n\n<p>When a new email is fetched from your mailbox, a new Support Ticket record is created and an automatic reply is sent to the sender indicating the Support Ticket Number. The sender can send additional information to this email. All subsequent emails containing this Support Ticket number in the subject will be added to this Support Ticket thread.

   "main_section": "<p>Payments made against Sales Invoices or Purchase Invoices can be made by clicking on \u201cMake Payment Entry\u201d button on \u201cSubmitted\u201d invoices.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Update the \u201cBank Account\u201d (you can also set the default account in the Company master).</li>\n<li>Update posting date.</li>\n<li>Enter the cheque number, cheque date.</li>\n<li>Save and Submit.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/payment-entry.png\" alt=\"Payment Entry\" /></p>\n\n<p>Payments can also be made independent of invoices by creating a new Journal Voucher and selecting the type of payment.</p>\n\n<h4>Incoming Payment</h4>\n\n<p>For payments from Customers,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Debit: Bank or Cash Account</li>\n<li>Credit: Customer</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note: Remember to the \u201cAgainst Sales Invoice\u201d or \u201cIs Advance\u201d as applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Outgoing Payment</h4>\n\n<p>For payments to Suppliers,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Debit: Supplier</li>\n<li>Credit: Bank or Cash Account</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note: Remember to the \u201cAgainst Purchase Invoice\u201d or \u201cIs Advance\u201d as applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Reconciling Cheque Payments</h3>\n\n<p>If you are receiving payments or making payments via cheques, the bank statements will not accurately match the dates of your entry, this is because the bank usually takes time to \u201cclear\u201d these payments. Also you may have mailed a cheque to your Supplier and it may be a few days before it is received and deposited by the Supplier. In ERPNext you can synchronize your bank statements and your Journal Vouchers using the \u201cBank Reconciliation\u201d tool.</p>\n\n<p>To use this, go to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Accounts &gt; Bank Reconciliation</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Select your \u201cBank\u201d Account and enter the dates of your statement. Here you will get all the \u201cBank Voucher\u201d type entries. In each of the entry on the right most column, update the \u201cClearance Date\u201d and click on \u201cUpdate\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>By doing this you will be able to sync your bank statements and entries into the system.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Managing Outstanding Payments</h2>\n\n<p>In most cases, apart from retail sales, billing and payments are separate activities. There are several combinations in which these payments are done. These cases apply to both sales and purchases.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They can be upfront (100% in advance).</li>\n<li>Post shipment. Either on delivery or within a few days of delivery.</li>\n<li>Part in advance and part on or post delivery.</li>\n<li>Payments can be made together for a bunch of invoices.</li>\n<li>Advances can be given together for a bunch of invoices (and can be split across invoices).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>ERPNext allows you to manage all these scenarios. All accounting entries (GL Entry) can be made against a Sales Invoice, Purchase Invoice or Journal Vouchers (in special cases, an invoice can be made via a Sales Invoice too).</p>\n\n<p>The total outstanding amount against an invoice is the sum of all the accounting entries that are made \u201cagainst\u201d (or are linked to) that invoice. This way you can combine or split payments in Journal Vouchers to manage the scenarios.</p>\n\n<h3>Matching Payments to Invoices</h3>\n\n<p>\ufffc\nIn complex scenarios, especially in the capital goods industry, sometimes there is no direct link between payments and invoices. You send invoices to your Customers and your Customer sends you block payments or payments based on some schedule that is not linked to your invoices. </p>\n\n<p>In such cases, you can use the Payment to Invoice Matching Tool.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Accounts &gt; Payment Reconciliation</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this tool, you can select an account (your Customer\u2019s account) and click on \u201cPull Payment Entries\u201d and it will select all un-linked Journal Vouchers and Sales Invoices from that Customer.</p>\n\n<p>To cancel off some payments and invoices, select the Invoices and Journal Vouchers and click on \u201cReconcile\u201d.</p>\n",

If Data Import is allowed, you will see an Import Button:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/import-1.png\" alt=\"Start Import\" /></p>\n\n<p>The tool has two sections, one to download a template and the second to upload the data.</p>\n\n<p>(Note: Only those DocTypes are allowed for Import whose Document Type is \"Master\" or Allow Import property is set.)</p>\n\n<h3>1. Downloading The Template</h3>\n\n<p>Data in ERPNext is stored in tables, much like a spreadsheet with columns and rows of data. Each entity in ERPNext can have multiple child tables associated with it too. The child tables are linked to the parent tables and are implemented where there are multiple values for any property. For example an Item can have multiple prices, An Invoice has multiple Items and so on.</p>\n\n<p>You can import each table separately, or all at a time. In the child table, you must mention the parent of the row in the \u201cparent\u201d column so that ERPNext knows which Item\u2019s price or tax you are trying to set if you are importing separately.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/import-2.png\" alt=\"Download The Template\" /></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Click on the table you want to download or \"All Tables\"</li>\n<li>For bulk editing, you can click on \"Download With Data\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>2. Fill in the Template</h3>\n\n<p>After downloading the template, open it in a spreadsheet application and fill in the data below the column headings.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/import-3.png\" alt=\"Spreadsheet\" /></p>\n\n<p>Then export your template or save it as a <strong>Comma Separated Values</strong> (CSV) file.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/import-4.png\" alt=\"Spreadsheet\" /></p>\n\n<h3>3. Upload the .csv File</h3>\n\n<p>Finally attach the .csv file in the section. Click on the \"Upload and Import\" button.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/import-5.png\" alt=\"Attach and Upload\" /></p>\n\n<p>Notes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure that if your application allows, use encoding as UTF-8. </li>\n<li>Keep the ID column blank for new records.</li>\n<li>Make sure you keep the modified column as it is for \"All Tables\".</li>\n<li>\"Parent\" column is mandatory for child type tables.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>4. Uploading All Tables (Main + Child)</h3>\n\n<p>If you select all tables, you will get columns belonging to all the tables in one row separated by <code>-</code> columns.</p>\n\n<p>If you have multiple child rows then you must start a new main item on a new row. See the example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Main Table                          -   Child Table\nColumn 1    Column 2    Column 3    -   Column 1    Column 2    Column 3\nv11         v12         v13             c11         c12         c13\n                                        c14         c15         c17\nv21         v22         v23             c21         c22         c23\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To see how its done, enter a few records manually using forms and export \"All Tables\" with \"Download with Data\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>5. Overwriting</h3>\n\n<p>ERPNext also allows you to overwrite all / certain columns. If you want to update certain columns, you can download the template with data.Remember to check on the \u201cOverwrite\u201d box before uploading.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note: For child records, if you select Overwrite, it will delete all the child records of that parent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>6. Upload Limitations</h3>\n\n<p>ERPNext restricts the amount of data you can upload in one file. Though the number may vary based on the type of data. It is usually safe to upload around 1000 rows of a table at one go. If the system will not accept, then you will see an error.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this? Uploading a lot of data can cause your system to crash, specially if there are other users doing things in parallel. Hence ERPNext restricts the number of \u201cwrites\u201d you can process in one request.</p>\n",

   "main_section": "<p>Point of sale (POS) is the place where a retail transaction is completed. It is the point at which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods or services. For retail operations, the delivery of goods, accrual of sale and payment all happens in one event, that is usually called the \u201cPoint of Sale\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>You can make a Sales Invoice of type POS by checking on \u201cIs POS\u201d. When you check this, you will notice that some fields get hidden and some new ones emerge.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tip: In retail, you may not create a separate Customer record for each customer. You can create a general Customer called \u201cWalk-in Customer\u201d and make all your transactions against this Customer record.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Different sections of the POS</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Update Stock: If this is checked, Stock Ledger Entries will be made when you \u201cSubmit\u201d this Sales Invoice thereby eliminating the need for a separate Delivery Note.\u2028</li>\n<li>In your Items table, update inventory information like Warehouse  (saved as default), Serial Number, or Batch Number if applicable.\u2028</li>\n<li>Update Payment Details like your Bank / Cash Account, Paid amount etc.\u2028</li>\n<li>If you are writing off certain amount. For example when you receive extra cash as a result of not having exact denomination of change, check on \u2018Write off Outstanding Amount\u2019 and set the Account.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Enable POS View</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Every Sales &amp; Purchase documents has 2 different interfaces, Invoice View and POS View. The current view used by most users is the Invoice View. This view is preferred by non-retailing companies.The POS view is used by retailing companies. For retailers it is very important to provide bill or sales invoice at the point of sale. Their customers cannot wait to receive the bill by post. The customers want an immediate bill for the payment which they make. In such cases, the POS View is preferred.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Setup  &gt; Show/Hide Features</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/pos-features-setup.png\" alt=\"POS View\" /></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Setup <a href=\"docs.user.setup.pos_setting.html\">POS Setting</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Adding an Item</h3>\n\n<p>At the billing counter, the retailer needs to select Items which the consumer buys. In the POS interface you can select an Item by two methods. One, is by clicking on the Item image and the other, is through the Barcode / Serial No. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Select Item</strong> - To select a  product click on the Item image and add it into the cart. A cart is an area that prepares a customer for checkout by allowing to edit product information, adjust taxes and add discounts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Barcode / Serial No</strong> - A Barcode / Serial No is an optical machine-readable representation of data relating to the object to which it is attached. Enter Barcode / Serial No in the box as shown in the image below and pause for a second, the item will be automatically added to the cart.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/pos-add-item.png\" alt=\"POS\" /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tip: To change the quantity of an Item, enter your desired quantity in the quantity box.

Then click on \u201cDel\u201d button. OR</p></li>\n<li><p>Enter 0(zero) quantity of any item to delete that item.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To remove multiple Items together, select multiple rows &amp; click on \u201cDel\u201d button. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Delete button appears only when Items are selected.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/pos-remove-item.png\" alt=\"POS\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Make Payment</h3>\n\n<p>After all the Items and their quantities are added into the cart, you are ready to make the Payment.

You can also find the value of all your items for your balance sheet. </p>\n\n<p>Valuation is important because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The buying price may fluctuate.</li>\n<li>The value may change because of some process (value add).</li>\n<li>The value may change because of decay, loss etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may encounter these terms, so lets clarify:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rate: Rate at which the transaction takes place.</li>\n<li>Valuation Rate: Rate at which the items value is set for your valuation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are two major ways in which ERPNext values your items.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>FIFO (First In First Out):</strong> In this system, ERPNext assumes that you will consume / sell those Items first which you bought first. For example, if you buy an Item at price X and then after a few days at price Y, whenever you sell your Item, ERPNext will reduce the quantity of the Item priced at X first and then Y.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/fifo.png\" alt=\"FIFO\" /></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Moving Average:</strong> In this method, ERPNext assumes that the value of the item at any point is the average price of the units of that Item in stock. For example, if the value of an Item is X in a Warehouse with quantity Y and another quantity Y1 is added to the Warehouse at cost X1, the new value X2 would be:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>New Value X2 = (X * Y + X1 * Y1) / (Y + Y1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

   "main_section": "<p>Emails are the nervous system of business communication and ERPNext has been designed to make good use of this. </p>\n\n<h2>Sending Emails</h2>\n\n<p>You can email any document from the system, by clicking on the \u201cEmail\u201d button on the right sidebar. Before that you will need to set your outgoing email settings (SMTP server).</p>\n\n<p>All emails sent from the system are added to the Communication table.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Info:</strong> What is SMTP? There are two types of email services, sending and receiving emails. Sending is done via a protocol called SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and the server (computer) that sends your email to its destination is called SMTP Server.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Info:</strong> Bulk Emails: Bulk Emails, especially those that are sent without consent (spam), are considered as bad behavior. While it may be okay to send emails to those who have \u201copted-in\u201d to receive mails, it is very difficult for the internet community to know what is spam and what is allowed. To overcome this problem, most email servers share a black and white list of email senders. If your emails have been marked as spam, you will be blacklisted. So be careful. Many times, it may be a good idea to send email via whitelisted services also known as SMTP relay services which are paid services. These services will block you from sending spam while ensuring that most of your email does not go in the spam folder. There are many such services available like SendGrid and SMTP.com</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To setup your outgoing mails, go to</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Setup &gt; Outgoing Email Settings &gt; Email Settings</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/email-settings1.png\" alt=\"Email Settings\" /></p>\n\n<p>Set your outgoing mail server settings here. These are the same settings you would use in your Outlook, Thunderbird, Apple Mail or other such email applications. If you are not sure, get in touch with your email service provider.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you are using EPRNext hosted service, keep the first section blank. Emails will still be sent from your email id, but via our SMTP relay service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Creating Support Tickets from Incoming Emails</h3>\n\n<p>A very useful email integration is to sync the incoming emails from support inbox into Support Ticket, so that you can track, assign and monitor support issues.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Case Study:</strong> Here at ERPNext, we have regularly tracked incoming support issues via email at \u201csupport@erpnext.com\u201d. At the time of writing we had answered more than 3000 tickets via this system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To setup your Support integration, go to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Setup &gt; Support Email Settings &gt; EMail Settings</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/email-settings2.png\" alt=\"Email Settings\" /></p>\n\n<p>To make ERPNext pull emails from your mail box, enter the POP3 settings. (POP3 is a way of extracting emails from your mailbox. It should be fairly easy to find out what your POP3 settings are. If you have problems, contact your email service provider).\nIf you want to setup an auto reply, check on the \u201cSend Autoreply\u201d box and whenever someone sends an email, an autoreply will be sent.\nAdd a custom signature which you want to send with your replies. </p>\n\n<h3>Setting Auto-notification on Documents</h3>\n\n<p>ERPNext allows you to automatically email documents on \u201cSubmission\u201d to the contact mentioned in the document. To set this up, go to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Setup &gt; Tools &gt; Enable / Disable Notifications.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/auto-notification.png\" alt=\"Auto Notification\" /></p>\n\n<p>Check on the transactions you want to send via email directly on Submission and add a custom message if you want on these documents.\n\ufffc</p>\n\n<h3>Email Digests</h3>\n\n<p>Email Digests allow you to get regular updates about your sales, expenses and other critical numbers directly in your Inbox. </p>\n\n<p>Set your frequency, check all the items you want to receive in your weekly update and select the user ids whom you want to send the Digest to.</p>\n\n<p>Email Digests are a great way for top managers to keep track of the big numbers like \u201cSales Booked\u201d or \u201cAmount Collected\u201d or \u201cInvoices Raised\u201d etc.</p>\n\n<p>To setup Email Digests, go to: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Setup &gt; Email Digest &gt; New Email Digest </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/email-digest.png\" alt=\"Email Digest\" /></p>\n",

   "main_section": "<p>A Sales Invoice is a bill that you send to your Customers, against which they will process your payment. </p>\n\n<p>If you have managed to create Sales Orders or Delivery Notes, creating a Sales Invoice follows the same process. </p>\n\n<p>You can create a Sales Invoice directly from</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Accounting &gt; Sales Invoice &gt; New Sales Invoice</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or from the \u201cMake Sales Invoice\u201d button in the Sales Order or Delivery Note.</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/sales-invoice.png\" alt=\"Sales Invoice\" /></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<h4>Accounting Impact</h4>\n\n<p>All Sales must be booked against an \u201cIncome Account\u201d. This refers to an Account in the \u201cIncome\u201d section of your Chart of Accounts. It is a good practice to classify your income by type (like product income, service income etc). The Income Account must be set for each row of the Items table.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tip: To set default Income Accounts for Items, you can set it in the Item or Item Group.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The other account that is affected is the Account of the Customer. That is automatically set from \u201cDebit To\u201d in the heading section.</p>\n\n<p>You must also mention the Cost Centers in which your Income must be booked. Remember that your Cost Centers tell you the profitability of the different lines of business or product. You can also set a default Cost Center in the Item master.</p>\n\n<h4>Accounting entries (GL Entry) for a typical double entry \u201cSale\u201d:</h4>\n\n<p>When booking a sale (accrual):</p>\n\n<p><strong>Debit:</strong> Customer (grand total)\n<strong>Credit:</strong> Income (net total, minus taxes for each Item) \n<strong>Credit:</strong> Taxes (liabilities to be paid to the government)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To see entries in your Sales Invoice after you \u201cSubmit\u201d, click on \u201cView Ledger\u201d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Dates</h4>\n\n<p>Posting Date: The date on which the Sales Invoice will affect your books of accounts i.e. your General Ledger. This will affect all your balances in that accounting period. </p>\n\n<p>Due Date: The date on which the payment is due (if you have sold on credit). This can be automatically set from the Customer master.</p>\n\n<h4>Recurring Invoices</h4>\n\n<p>If you have a contract with a Customer where you bill the Customer on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annual basis, you can check the \u201cRecurring Invoice\u201d box. Here you can fill in the details of how frequently you want to bill this Invoice and the period for which the contract is valid.</p>\n\n<p>ERPNext will automatically create new Invoices and mail it to the email ids you set.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4>\"Pro Forma\" Invoice</h4>\n\n<p>If you want to give an Invoice to a Customer to make a payment before you deliver, i.e. you operate on a payment first basis, you should create a Quotation and title it as a \u201cPro-forma Invoice\u201d (or something similar) using the Print Heading feature. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cPro Forma\u201d means for formality. Why do this? Because if you book a Sales Invoice it will show up in your \u201cAccounts Receivable\u201d and \u201cIncome\u201d. This is not ideal as your Customer may or may not decide to pay up. But since your Customer wants an \u201cInvoice\u201d, you could give the Customer a Quotation (in ERPNext) titled as \u201cPro Forma Invoice\u201d. This way everyone is happy.</p>\n\n<p>This is a fairly common practice. We follow this at Web Notes too.</p>\n",

   "main_section": "<p>If you already have a full-fledged business with a number of physical items, you would have probably coded your items. If you have not, you have a choice. We recommend that you should codify if you have lot of products with long or complicated names. In case you have few products with short names, it is preferable to keep the Item Code same as Item Name.</p>\n\n<p>Item codification has been a sensitive topic and wars have been fought on this (not joking). In our experience, when you have items that cross a certain size, life without codification is a nightmare. </p>\n\n<h3>Benefits</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Standard way of naming things.</li>\n<li>Less likely to have duplicates.</li>\n<li>Explicit definition.</li>\n<li>Helps to quickly find if a similar item exists.</li>\n<li>Item names get longer and longer as more types get introduced. Codes are shorter.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Pain</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You have to remember the codes!</li>\n<li>Harder for new team members to pick up.</li>\n<li>You have to create new codes all the time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<p>You should have a simple manual / cheat-sheet to codify your Items instead of just numbering them sequentially. Each letter should mean something. Here is an example:</p>\n\n<p>If your business involves wooden furniture, then you may codify as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Item Codification Summary Sheet\n(SAMPLE)</p>\n\n<pre><code>First letter: \"Material\"            Third letter: \"Size\"\n\n- W - Wood                          - 0 - less than 1mm\n- H - Hardware                      - 1 - 1mm - 5mm\n- G - Glass                         - 2 - 5mm - 10mm\n- U - Upholstery                    - 3 - 10mm - 10cm\n- P - Plastic\n\nSecond Letter: \"Type\"\n\nFor Wood:                           For Hardware:\n\n- S - Sheet                         - S - Screw\n- B - Bar                           - N - Nut\n- L - L-section                     - W - Washer\n- M - Molded                        - B - Bracket\n- R - Round\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The last few letters could be sequential. So by looking at code <strong>WM304</strong> - you know its a wooden molding less than 10cm in size </p>\n\n<h3>Standardization</h3>\n\n<p>If you have more than one person naming items, the style of naming items will change for everyone. Sometimes, even for one person, he or she may forget how they had named the item and may create a duplicate name <em>\"Wooden Sheet 3mm\" or \"3mm Sheet of Wood\"?</em></p>\n\n<h3>Rationalizing</h3>\n\n<p>It is a good practice to have minimum varieties of items so that you keep minimum stock, housekeeping is simpler etc. When you are planning a new product and you want to know if you are already purchasing a part in some other product, the item codes will help you quickly determine if you are using a similar raw material in another product.</p>\n\n<p>We believe if you do this small investment, it will help you rationalize things as your business grows, though its okay not to codify if you have less items.</p>\n",

These are your Leads.</p>\n\n<p>They are called Leads because they may lead you to a sale. Sales people usually work on leads by calling them, building a relationship and sending information about their products or services. It is important to track all this conversation to enable another person who may have to follow-up on that contact. The new person is then able to know the history of that particular Lead.</p>\n\n<p>To create a Lead, go to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Selling &gt; Lead &gt; New Lead</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/lead.png\" alt=\"Lead\" /></p>\n\n<p>ERPNext gives you a lot of options you may want to store about your Leads. For example what is the source, how likely are they to give you business etc. If you have a healthy number of leads, this information will help you prioritize who you want to work with.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> ERPNext makes it easy to follow-up on leads by updating the \u201cNext Contact\u201d details. This will add a new event in the Calendar for the User who has to contact the lead next.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Difference between Lead, Contact and Customer</h3>\n\n<p>The difference is that a Lead is a potential Customer, someone who can give you business. A Customer is an organization or individual who has given you business before (and has an Account in your system). A Contact is a person who belongs to the Customer.</p>\n\n<p>A Lead can be converted to a Customer by clicking on the \u201cCreate Customer\u201d button. Once the Customer is created, the Lead becomes \u201cConverted\u201d and any further Opportunities from the same source can be created against the Customer.</p>\n",

Using web requests you can insert, update, query, run public triggers etc. The basic scheme is as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>All API calls are to me made to <code>server.py</code> on your public folder of your erpnext account. For hosted users, it is (yourdomain.erpnext.com).</li>\n<li>The <code>cmd</code> parameter points to the python function to be executed.</li>\n<li>Authentication is managed using cookies.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Authentication</h3>\n\n<p>Authentication is done via the login method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>GET server.py?cmd=login&amp;usr=[username]&amp;password=[password]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The login method returns a session id <code>sid</code> cookie in the header and a status in the\nbody of the request. The <code>sid</code> cookie must be sent for each subsequent request.</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ curl -I http://localhost/webnotes/erpnext/public/server.py?cmd=login\\&amp;usr=Administrator\\&amp;pwd=admin\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Tue, 23 Jul 2013 05:29:24 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.2.22 (Unix) DAV/2 mod_ssl/2.2.22 OpenSSL/0.9.8r\nSet-Cookie: country=None\nSet-Cookie: sid=d0ce00d49c24869984960607a2467b50ff59b0024741922db4b23818; expires=Fri, 26 Jul 2013 10:59:25\nContent-Length: 32\nContent-Type: text/html; charset: utf-8\n\n{\"message\":\"Logged In\",\"exc\":\"\"}\n\n$ curl http://localhost/webnotes/erpnext/public/server.py?cmd=webnotes.client.get\\&amp;doctype=Profile\\&amp;name=Administrator -b sid=d0ce00d49c24869984960607a2467b50ff59b0024741922db4b23818\n\n{\n    \"message\":[\n        {\n            \"user_image\":null,\n            \"last_name\":\"User\",\n            \"last_ip\":\"::1\",\n            ..\n            ..\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Python Remote Client</h3>\n\n<p>You can use the <code>webclient.py</code> module as an example of how to access data using the webservice API</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/webnotes/wnframework/blob/master/webnotes/utils/webclient.py\">Code</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://erpnext.org/docs.dev.framework.server.webnotes.utils.webclient.html\">Docs</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Passing and Receiving Documents (<code>doclist</code>)</h3>\n\n<p>To insert or update documents in ERPNext you have to pass them as a JSON Object.

   "main_section": "<p>ERPNext has a role-based permission system, which means that you can assign Roles to Users, and Permissions on Roles.</p>\n\n<p>ERPNext has a very powerful permission structure that will allow you to set permissions right up to the field level.</p>\n\n<p>Permissions are applied on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Roles:</strong> As we saw earlier, Users are assigned to Roles and it is on these Roles that permission rules are applied.\ufffc</li>\n<li><strong>Document Types:</strong> Each type of document, master or transaction, has a separate list of Role based permission.</li>\n<li><strong>Document Stages:</strong> Permissions are applied on each stage of the document like on Creation, Saving, Submission, Cancellation and Amendment. </li>\n<li><strong>Permission \u201cLevels\u201d:</strong> In each document, you can group fields by \u201clevels\u201d. Each group of field is denoted by a unique number (1,2,3 etc.). A separate set of permission rules can be applied to each field group. By default all fields are of level 0.</li>\n<li><strong>\u201cMatch Rules\u201d</strong> Based on certain properties of the document and the user: This can be used in cases where, for example, you have multiple Companies or sales persons in different Territories and you want to restrict each User to only view documents relating to the User\u2019s Company or Territory etc. It is also called \u201cmatch\u201d rules.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When you define a \u201cmatch\u201d rule, the User will only be allowed to access (or write) the document if the User has one or more such values (e.g. Company, Territories) and the document has the same values. \u2028\u2028For example, if you have set a match rule on Sales Order for a particular Role based on \u201cterritory\u201d, then all users of that Role will only be allowed to view Sales Orders of that Territory. Let us walk through an example.</p>\n\n<p>ERPNext comes with pre-set permission rules that you can change anytime by going to</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Setup &gt; Users and Permissions &gt; Permission Manager</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/permission-manager.png\" alt=\"Permission Manager\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Using the Permission Manager</h2>\n\n<p>The Permission Manager is an easy way to set / unset permission rules. The Permission Manager allows you to monitor rules per Document Type.</p>\n\n<p>When you select a document type from the drop-down. You will see the rules that have already been applied.</p>\n\n<p>To add a new rule, click on \u201cAdd a New Rule\u201d button and a pop-up box will ask you to select a Role and a Permission Level. Once you select this and click on \u201cAdd\u201d, this will add a new row to your rules table.</p>\n\n<p>To edit rules, just check or uncheck the boxes stating the permission level and Role and click on \u201cUpdate\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>To delete a rule, just uncheck all the boxes of the row and click on \u201cUpdate\u201d\u2028</p>\n\n<p>To set \u201cmatch\u201d rules, select the drop-down in the last column.\u2028\u2028For example, you want to restrict Users of Role \u201cSales User\u201d by Territories in Sales Order. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select Sales Order in \u201cSet Permissions For\u201d</li>\n<li>In the row for Role \u201cSales User\u201d, in the last column \u201cRestrict By\u201d, select \u201cterritory\u201d.</li>\n<li>To assign Territories to Users, click on \u201cSet Users / Roles\u201d</li>\n<li>In the popup box, \n<ul>\n<li>In the \u201cWho\u201d column, select \u201cProfile\u201d and the User you want to assign the Territory to</li>\n<li>In the \u201cIs allowed if territory equals\u201d column, select the Territory you want to assign   to this user.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Click on \u201cAdd\u201d</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In the same way, add a row for each user.</p>\n\n<h4>Step 1: Select Sales Order in \"Set Permissions For\"</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/permission-manager-1.png\" alt=\"Permissions Manager\" /></p>\n\n<h4>Step 2: Select restriction option as Territory</h4>\n\n<p><br>\n<img src=\"files/permission-manager-2.png\" alt=\"Permissions Manager\" /></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<h4>Step 3: To assign Territories to users, click on \"Set Users/Roles\"</h4>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/permission-manager-3.png\" alt=\"Permissions Manager\" /></p>\n\n<h4>Step 3: Restrict User by selecting Territory</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/permission-manager-4.png\" alt=\"Permission Manager\" /></p>\n\n<h4>Step 4: Select the User to assign to a Territory</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/permission-manager-5.png\" alt=\"Permission Manager\" /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Note 1:</strong> The \u201cmatch\u201d rules apply to all documents that you have matched by Territory.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Note 2:</strong> You can set multiple rules for the same User. In this example, you can set a User to access more than one Territories.\n  \u2028</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you have more than two companies, we recommend that you should maintain seperate databases for these companies (2/3 ERPnext accounts). This avoids data leak from one company to another.</p>\n",

   "main_section": "<h3>Preamble</h3>\n\n<p>wnframework is, a Python based, meta-data driven framework. The framework implements \nits own object-relational model (ORM) and provides a rich client interface based on \nJavascript. It is primararily used to develop <a href=\"https://github.com/webnotes/erpnext\">ERPNext</a></p>\n\n<p>To develop on wnframework, you must have a basic understanding of how web applications \nand client-server architectures work. On the server-side, requests are handled by Python \nmodules via CGI. So each request is a new thread and there is no state preservation on \nthe server. Session data is stored in memcached server.</p>\n\n<p>WNFramework also has way you metadata is defined, called a <code>DocType</code>. Everything \nobject in the system like a Customer or Journal Voucher is a <code>DocType</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, be prepared for a slight learning curve. A lot of the inner code / design \nis not very elegant and you might encounter spaghetti at certain places. We are working \nto reduce all of that.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Meta data</h2>\n\n<p>Base model in wnframework is called a <code>DocType</code>. A <code>DocType</code> represents a database table, \na web form and a controller to execute business logic. In classical MVC terms it is all \nthree model, view and controller to an extent.</p>\n\n<p><code>DocType</code> objects have <code>DocField</code>s that are properties of the model.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Client-Server Setup</h2>\n\n<p>Let us understand how to setup web folders via ERPNext</p>\n\n<p>An ERPNext setup contains 2 repositories <a href=\"/webnotes/erpnext\">erpnext</a> and \n<a href=\"/webnotes/wnframework\">wnframework</a>. In the main folder of the erpnext setup there \nare 3 folders:</p>\n\n<pre><code>+ lib\n+ app\n+ public\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <strong>lib</strong> folder represents <em>wnframework</em>, the <strong>app</strong> folder represents <em>erpnext</em> and \nthe <strong>public</strong> folder is served on the web.</p>\n\n<p>To build the public folder for the first time, run this utility from the base folder:</p>\n\n<p><code>$ lib/wnf.py -b</code></p>\n\n<p>All web pages are served by <code>public/web.py</code> and all data requests are served \nby <code>public/server.py</code></p>\n\n<p>The server-side libraries are in <code>lib/webnotes</code> and client-side libraries are \nin <code>lib/public/wn</code> folders.</p>\n\n<h3>Requests &amp; Routings</h3>\n\n<p>There are 2 types of requests, requests for web pages (when the user is not logged in) and \ndata requests when the user is logged in. Let us see data requests:</p>\n\n<p>All data requests are made on <code>public/server.py</code>. The method and parameters are passed as \nform parameters. </p>\n\n<p>The <code>cmd</code> paramter represents the python method to be executed. This is the \"routing\" used \nin wnframwork. Use the <code>@webnotes.whitelist()</code> decorator to whitelist a particular method \nto be accessible by the web.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the request:</p>\n\n<p><code>server.py?cmd=accounts.utils.get_account&amp;account_name=Test</code></p>\n\n<p>will call the <code>get_account</code> method in <code>app/accounts/utils.py</code>. </p>\n\n<h4>Repsonse</h4>\n\n<p>The return to that will be sent as a JSON object</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n  \"message\": \"returned by get_account\", \n  \"server_messages\":\"Any popup messages to be displayed\", \n  \"exc\": \"Any exceptions encountered\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once the control is passed on to the method, the response is sent back via JSON.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Front End</h2>\n\n<p>The front end is a Javascript based client application. You can login by opening the login \npage from your browser. If you have setup your apache routes correctly, just go to <br />\n<code>localhost/public/login</code> or equivalent to see the login page. This actually translates \ninto <code>public/web.py?page=login</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Once you login, you will be redirected to <code>app.html</code> that fires up the application front-end.</p>\n\n<h3>URL routing:</h3>\n\n<p>Different pages / objects are accessed by url fragments <code>#</code></p>\n\n<h4>Forms</h4>\n\n<p>All objects are accessible via <code>#Form/[DocType]/[Doument Name]</code> on the URL.</p>\n\n<p>To open the customer <strong>DocType</strong>, you can go to <code>#Form/DocType/Customer</code> or to open \na Customer, <strong>Customer A</strong>, go to <code>#Form/Customer/Customer A</code></p>\n\n<h4>Pages</h4>\n\n<p>Static pages in the application are accessed by their name. For example, the home \npage called <code>desktop</code> can be accessed by <code>#desktop</code></p>\n\n<h4>Client Application</h4>\n\n<p>The client application is bunch of js libraries that help in navigation, rendering \nforms, reports and other components. The application code in <code>public/js/all-app.js</code> \nis built by combining files specified in <code>lib/public/build.json</code> and <code>app/public/build.json</code>.\n To rebuild the client application after making a change, call <code>lib/wnf.py -b</code> from the \ncommand line.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Application / Module Development</h2>\n\n<h3>Creating / Editing DocTypes</h3>\n\n<p>To create or edit the <strong>DocType</strong> \"schema\" you will have to fire the front-end via a \nweb-browser and login as Administrator. To open a <strong>DocType</strong>, \ngo to Document &gt; Search &gt; DocType and select the <strong>DocType</strong> to edit.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>DocType</strong> form should be self explanatory. It has a list of fields that are \nused for both the database table and form. Special fields like <code>Column Break</code> and \n<code>Section Break</code> are present to make the form layout that is processed sequentially.</p>\n\n<p>DocType is discovered via permissions (<code>DocPerm</code>) and by URL routes. </p>\n\n<p>Once you save a <strong>DocType</strong>, the database schema is automatically update, while \ndeveloping, you should fire up a mysql command-line or viewer to see the impact \nof your database changes.</p>\n\n<h3>Adding code to DocTypes</h3>\n\n<p>You can add business logic by writing event code on both client and server side. \nThe server side events are written in Python and client side events are written in \nJavascript.</p>\n\n<p>The files from where these events are picked up are in the module folders in the \nrepositories. Apart from the <code>core</code> module, all modules are parts \nof <strong>erpnext</strong> (<code>app</code> folder). Each DocType has its own folder in the module in a \nfolder called <code>doctype</code>. If you browse the files of <strong>erpnext</strong>, you should be able \nto locate these files easily.</p>\n\n<h4>Server-side modules</h4>\n\n<p>For example, the server-side script for DocType <strong>Account</strong> in module <strong>Accounts</strong> \nwill be present in the folder <code>app/accounts/doctype/account/account.py</code></p>\n\n<p>The events are declared as a part of class called <code>DocType</code>. In the <code>DocType</code> \nclass there are two main useful properties:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>doc</code>: Represents the main record.</li>\n<li><code>doclist</code>: Represents list of records (including child records) that are associated \nwith this DocType. For example the <code>doclist</code> of <strong>Sales Order</strong> will have the main record \nand all <strong>Sales Order Item</strong> records.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The main serverside events are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>validate</code>: Called before the <code>INSERT</code> or <code>UPDATE</code> method is called.</li>\n<li><code>on_update</code>: Called after saving.</li>\n<li><code>on_submit</code>: Called after submission</li>\n<li><code>on_cancel</code>: Called after cancellation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See a sample server side file for more info!</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Custom UI: Pages</h2>\n\n<p>Custom UI like <strong>Chart of Accounts</strong> etc, is made by Pages. Pages are free form virtual \npages in that are rendered on the client side. A page can have an <code>.html</code> (layout), \n<code>.py</code> (server calls), <code>.js</code> (user interface) and <code>.css</code> (style) components.</p>\n\n<p>Understand how pages work, it is best to open an existing page and see how it works.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Patching &amp; Deployment</h2>\n\n<p>Data / schema changes are done to wnframwork via patches released in the <code>app/patches</code> \nmodule (see erpnext folder for more details). To run all latest patches that have not \nbeen executed, run <code>lib/wnf.py -l</code></p>\n\n<p>wnframework deployment is done by the <code>lib/wnf.py</code> utility.</p>\n\n<p>See <code>lib/wnf.py --help</code> for more help.</p>\n\n<p><em>Good luck!</em></p>\n",

Examples of transactions include Sales Invoices, Quotations etc. You make transactions against a number of master records.</p>\n\n<p>ERPNext allows you to make prefixes to your transactions, with each prefix forming its own series. For example a series with prefix INV12 will have numbers INV120001, INV120002 and so on.</p>\n\n<p>You can have multiple series for all your transactions. It is common to have a separate series for each financial year. For example in Sales Invoice you could have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>INV120001</li>\n<li>INV120002</li>\n<li>INV-A-120002</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>etc. You could also have a separate series for each type of Customer or for each of your retail outlets.</p>\n\n<p>To setup a series, go to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Setup &gt; Tools &gt; Update Numbering Series</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/naming-series.png\" alt=\"Document Naming Series\" /></p>\n\n<p>In this form,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select the transaction for which you want to make the series\nThe system will update the current series in the text box.</li>\n<li>Edit the series as required with unique prefixes for each series. Each prefix must be on a new line.</li>\n<li>The first prefix will be the default prefix. If you want the user to explicitly select a series instead of the default one, check the \u201cUser must always select\u201d check box.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You can also update the starting point for a series by entering the series name and the starting point in the \u201cUpdate Series\u201d section.</p>\n",

A customer can also receive goods or services from a vendor or a supplier for other valuable considerations.</p>\n\n<p>You can either directly create your Customers via </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Selling &gt; Customer</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or upload it via the Data Import Tool.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/customer.png\" alt=\"Customer Master\" /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note: Customers are separate from Contacts and Addresses. A Customer can have multiple Contacts and Addresses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Contacts and Addresses</h3>\n\n<p>\ufffc\nContacts and Addresses in ERPNext are stored separately so that you can attach multiple Contacts or Addresses to Customers and Suppliers.</p>\n\n<p>To add a Contact or Address directly from the Customer record, click on \u201cNew Contact\u201d or \u201cNew Address\u201d.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tip: When you select a Customer in any transaction, one Contact and Address gets pre-selected. This is the \u201cDefault Contact or Address\u201d. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To Import multiple Contacts and Addresses from a spreadsheet, use the Data Import Tool.</p>\n\n<h3>Integration with Accounts</h3>\n\n<p>In ERPNext, there is a separate Account record for each Customer, for each Company.</p>\n\n<p>When you create a new Customer, ERPNext will automatically create an Account Ledger for the Customer under \u201cAccounts Receivable\u201d in the Company set in the Customer record. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Advanced Tip: If you want to change the Account Group under which the Customer Account is created, you can set it in the Company master.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you want to create an Account in another Company, just change the Company value and \u201cSave\u201d the Customer again.</p>\n\n<h3>Customer Settings</h3>\n\n<p>You can link a Price List to a Customer (select \u201cDefault Price List\u201d), so that when you select that Customer, the Price List will be automatically selected.</p>\n\n<p>You can set \u201cCredit Days\u201d so that it is automatically set in the Sales Invoices made against this Customer.</p>\n\n<p>You can set how much credit you want to allow for a Customer by adding the \u201cCredit Limit\u201d. You can also set a global \u201cCredit Limit\u201d in the Company master.\fClassifying Customers</p>\n\n<p>ERPNext allows you to group your Customers and also divide them into Territories. Grouping will help you get better analysis of your data and identify which Customers are profitable and which are not. Territories will help you set sales targets for the respective territories.</p>\n\n<h3>Customer Group</h3>\n\n<p>You can group your Customers so that you can get trend analysis for each group. Typically Customers are grouped by market segment (that is usually based on your domain).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tip: If you think all this is too much effort, you can leave it at \u201cDefault Customer Group\u201d. But all this effort, will pay off when you start getting reports.\n  \ufffc\n  An example of a sample report is given below:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/sales-analytics-customer.png\" alt=\"Sales Analytics\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Territory</h3>\n\n<p>If your business operates in multiple Territories (could be countries, states or cities) it is usually a great idea to build your structure in the system. Once you group your Customers by Territories, you can set annual targets for each Item Group and get reports that will show your actual performance in the territory v/s what you had planned.</p>\n\n<h3>Sales Person</h3>\n\n<p>Sales Persons behave exactly like Territories. You can create an organization chart of Sales Persons where each Sales Person\u2019s target can be set individually. Again as in Territory, the target has to be set against Item Group.</p>\n\n<h3>Sales Partner</h3>\n\n<p>A Sales Partner is a third party distributor / dealer / commission agent / affiliate / reseller who sells the companies products, for a commission. This is useful if you make the end sale to the Customer, involving your Sales Partner.</p>\n\n<p>If you sell to your Sales Partner who in-turn sells it to the Customer, then you must make a Customer instead.</p>\n",

   "main_section": "<p>The concept of accounting is explained with an example given below: \nWe will take a \"Tea Stall\" as a company and see how to book accounting entries for the business.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mama (The Tea-stall owner) invests Rs 25000 to start the business.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/assets-1.png\" alt=\"A&amp;L\" /></p>\n\n<p>Analysis: Mama invested 25000 in company, hoping to get some profit. In other words, company is liable to pay 25000 to Mama in the future. So, account \"Mama\" is a liability account and it is credited. Company's cash balance will be increased due to the investment, \"Cash\" is an asset to the company and it will debited.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The company needs equipments (Stove, teapot, cups etc) and raw materials (tea, sugar, milk etc) immediately. He decides to buy from the nearest general store \"Super Bazaar\" who is a friend so that he gets some credit. Equipments cost him 2800 and raw materials worth of 2200. He pays 2000 out of total cost 5000.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/assets-2.png\" alt=\"A&amp;L\" /></p>\n\n<p>Analysis: Equipments are \"Fixed Assets\" (because they have a long life) of the company and raw materials \"Current Assets\" (since they are used for day-to-day business), of the company. So, \"Equipments\" and \"Stock in Hand\" accounts have been debited to increase the value. He pays 2000, so \"Cash\" account will be reduced by that amount, hence credited and he is liable to pay 3000 to \"Super Bazaar\" later, so Super Bazaar will be credited by 3000.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mama (who takes care of all entries) decides to book sales at the end of the every day, so that he can analyze daily sales. At the end of the very first day, the tea stall sells 325 cups of tea, which gives net sales of Rs. 1575. The owner happily books his first day sales.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/assets-3.png\" alt=\"A&amp;L\" /></p>\n\n<p>Analysis: Income has been booked in \"Sales of Tea\" account which has been credited to increase the value and the same amount will be debited to \"Cash\" account. Lets say, to make 325 cups of tea, it costs Rs. 800, so \"Stock in Hand\" will be reduced (Cr) by 800 and expense will be booked in \"Cost of goods sold\" account by same amount.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the month, the company paid the rent amount of stall (5000) and salary of one employee (8000), who joined from the very first day.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/assets-4.png\" alt=\"A&amp;L\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Booking Profit</h3>\n\n<p>As month progress, company purchased more raw materials for the business. After a month he books profit to balance the \"Balance Sheet\" and \"Profit and Loss Statements\" statements. Profit belongs to Mama and not the company hence its a liability for the company (it has to pay it to Mama). When the Balance Sheet is not balanced i.e. Debit is not equal to Credit, the profit has not yet been booked. To book profit, the following entry has to be made:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/assets-5.png\" alt=\"A&amp;L\" /></p>\n\n<p>Explanation: Company's net sales and expenses are 40000 and 20000 respectively. So, company made a profit of 20000. To make the profit booking entry, \"Profit or Loss\" account has been debited and \"Capital Account\" has been credited. Company's net cash balance is 44000 and there is some raw materials available worth 1000 rupees.</p>\n",

   "main_section": "<p>Purchase Invoice is the exact opposite of your Sales Invoice. It is the bill that your Supplier sends you for products or services delivered. Here you accrue expenses to your Supplier. Making a Purchase Invoice is very similar to making a Purchase Order.</p>\n\n<p>To make a new Purchase Invoice, go to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Accounts &gt; Purchase Invoice &gt; New Purchase Invoice</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or click on \u201cMake Purchase Invoice\u201d in Purchase Order or Purchase Receipt.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/purchase-invoice.png\" alt=\"Purchase Invoice\" /></p>\n\n<p>The concept of \u201cPosting Date\u201d is again same as Sales Invoice. \u201cBill No\u201d and \u201cBill Date\u201d helps to track the bill number as set by your Supplier for reference.</p>\n\n<h4>Accounting Impact</h4>\n\n<p>Like in Sales Invoice, you have to enter an Expense or an Asset account for each row in your Items table. This helps to indicate if the Item is an Asset or an Expense. You must also enter a Cost Center. These can also be set in the Item master.</p>\n\n<p>The Purchase Invoice will affect your accounts as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Accounting entries (GL Entry) for a typical double entry \u201cpurchase\u201d:</p>\n\n<p>Debits:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Expense or Asset (net totals, excluding taxes)</li>\n<li>Taxes (assets if VAT-type or expense again).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Supplier</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To see entries in your Purchase Invoice after you \u201cSubmit\u201d, click on \u201cView Ledger\u201d.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4>Is purchase an \u201cExpense\u201d or an \u201cAsset\u201d?</h4>\n\n<p>If the Item is consumed immediately on purchase, or if it is a service, then the purchase becomes an \u201cExpense\u201d. For example, a telephone bill or travel bill is an \u201cExpense\u201d - it is already consumed.</p>\n\n<p>For inventory Items, that have a value, these purchases are not yet \u201cExpense\u201d, because they still have a value while they remain in your stock. They are \u201cAssets\u201d. If they are raw-materials (used in a process), they will become \u201cExpense\u201d the moment they are consumed in the process. If they are to be sold to a Customer, they become \u201cExpense\u201d when you ship them to the Customer.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4>Deducting Taxes at Source</h4>\n\n<p>In many countries, the law may require you to deduct taxes, while paying your suppliers. These taxes could be based on a standard rate. Under these type of schemes, typically if a Supplier crosses a certain threshold of payment, and if the type of product is taxable, you may have to deduct some tax (which you pay back to your government, on your Supplier\u2019s behalf).</p>\n\n<p>To do this, you will have to make a new Tax Account under \u201cTax Liabilities\u201d or similar and credit this Account by the percent you are bound to deduct for every transaction.</p>\n\n<p>For more help, please contact your Accountant!\f</p>\n",

In each row, you must specify:\n<ul>\n<li>The Account that will be affected</li>\n<li>The amount to Debit or Credit</li>\n<li>The Cost Center (if it is an Income or Expense)</li>\n<li>Against Voucher: Link it to a voucher or invoice if it affects the \u201coutstanding\u201d amount of that invoice.</li>\n<li>Is Advance: Select \u201cYes\u201d if you want to make it selectable in an Invoice.\u2028\nOther information in case it is a Bank Payment or a bill.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Difference</h4>\n\n<p>The \u201cDifference\u201d field is the difference between the Debit and Credit amounts. This should be zero if the Journal Voucher is to be \u201cSubmitted\u201d. If this number is not zero, you can click on \u201cMake Difference Entry\u201d to add a new row with the amount required to make the total as zero.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Common Entries</h2>\n\n<p>A look at some of the common accounting entries that can be done via Journal Voucher.</p>\n\n<h4>Expenses (non accruing)</h4>\n\n<p>Many times it may not be necessary to accrue an expense, but it can be directly booked against an expense Account on payment. For example a travel allowance or a telephone bill. You can directly debit Telephone Expense (instead of your telephone company) and credit your Bank on payment.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Debit: Expense Account (like Telephone expense)</li>\n<li>Credit: Bank or Cash Account</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Bad Debts or Write Offs</h4>\n\n<p>If you are writing off an Invoice as a bad debt, you can create a Journal Voucher similar to a Payment, except instead of debiting your Bank, you can debit an Expense Account called Bad Debts.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Debit: Bad Debts Written Off</li>\n<li>Credit: Customer</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note: There may be regulations in your country before you can write off bad debts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Depreciation</h4>\n\n<p>Depreciation is when you write off certain value of your assets as an expense. For example if you have a computer that you will use for say 5 years, you can distribute its expense over the period and pass a Journal Voucher at the end of each year reducing its value by a certain percentage.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Debit: Depreciation (Expense)</li>\n<li>Credit: Asset (the Account under which you had booked the asset to be depreciated)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note: There may be regulations in your country that define by how much amount you can depreciate a class of Assets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

This <code>locale</code> folder is rebuilt every time new translations are made.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the user preferences or request preferences, the appropriate translations are loaded at the time of request on the server side.

Do <code>lib/wnf.py --help</code> for more info.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>New translations are built using Google Translate API. As of the time of writing of this document, Google Translate API is not free. To build a translation of your own from Google, you will have to register with Google API and add your API key in <code>conf.py</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To add a new language just add:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Build new translation from Google: <code>lib/wnf.py --translate ru</code></li>\n<li>Get user the ability to select this language: Go to #Form/DocType/Profile and update the options in <code>langauge</code> field.</li>\n<li>Map the language name to the abbreviation: Update <code>startup/__init__.py</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/webnotes/erpnext/blob/master/startup/__init__.py\">Link</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Updating Translations</h3>\n\n<h4>Updating Sources:</h4>\n\n<p>If you find translatable strings are not properly annotated using the <code>_</code> method, you can add them in the code and rebuild the translations.</p>\n\n<h4>Improving Translations:</h4>\n\n<p>To improve an existing translation, just edit the master translation files in <code>app/translations</code> and rebuild using <code>lib/wnf.py -b</code></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Please contribute your translations back to ERPNext by sending us a Pull Request.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

Following are the details of Purchase Receipt:</p>\n\n<p><b>Supplier:</b> East Wind Inc.</p>\n\n<p><b>Items:</b></p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Item</th><th>Warehouse</th><th>Qty</th>\n            <th>Rate</th><th>Amount</th><th>Valuation Amount</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>RM0001</td><td>Stores</td><td>10</td><td>200</td><td>2000</td><td>2200</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Desktop</td><td>Fixed Asset Warehouse</td>\n            <td>5</td><td>100</td><td>500</td><td>550</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>Taxes:</strong></p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n    <thead>\n        <tr><th>Account</th><th>Amount</th><th>Category</th></tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr><td>Shipping Charges</td><td>100</td><td>Total and Valuation</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>VAT</td><td>120</td><td>Total</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Customs Duty</td><td>150</td><td>Valuation</td></tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>Stock Ledger</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/accounting-for-stock-2.png\" alt=\"pr<em>stock</em>ledger\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>General Ledger</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/accounting-for-stock-3.png\" alt=\"pr<em>general</em>ledger\" /></p>\n\n<p>As stock balance increases through Purchase Receipt, \"Store\" and \"Fixed Asset Warehouse\" accounts are debited and a temporary account \"Stock Receipt But Not Billed\" account is credited, to maintain double entry accounting system.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3><strong>Purchase Invoice</strong></h3>\n\n<p>On receiving Bill from supplier, for the above Purchase Receipt, you will make Purchase Invoice for the same. The general ledger entries are as follows:</p>\n\n<p><strong>General Ledger</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/accounting-for-stock-4.png\" alt=\"pi<em>general</em>ledger\" /></p>\n\n<p>Here \"Stock Received But Not Billed\" account is debited and nullified the effect of Purchase Receipt. \"Expenses Included In Valuation\" account has been credited which ensures the valuation expense accounts are not booked (debited) twice (in Purchase Invoice and Delivery Note).</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3><strong>Delivery Note</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Lets say, you have an order from \"Jane Doe\" to deliver 5 nos of item \"RM0001\" at $300.

The debit/credit amount is equal to the total valuation amount (buying cost) of the selling items. And valuation amount is calculated based on your prefferred valuation method (FIFO / Moving Average) or actual cost of serialized items.</p>\n\n<pre>\n    <code>\nIn this example, we have considered valuation method as FIFO. \nValuation Rate  = Purchase Rate + Charges Included in Valuation \n                = 200 + (250 * (2000 / 2500) / 10) \n                = 220\nTotal Valuation Amount  = 220 * 5 \n                        = 1100\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3><strong>Sales Invoice with Update Stock</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Lets say, you did not make Delivery Note against the above order and instead you have made Sales Invoice directly, with \"Update Stock\" options.

   "main_section": "<p>Purchase Receipts are made when you accept material from your Supplier usually against a Purchase Order. </p>\n\n<p>You can also accept Purchase Receipts directly (you must set Purchase Order Required as \u201cNo\u201d in Global Defaults).</p>\n\n<p>You can make a Purchase Receipt directly from:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Stock &gt; Purchase Receipt &gt; New Purchase Receipt</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or from a \u201cSubmitted\u201d Purchase Order, by clicking on \u201cMake Purchase Receipt\u201d.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/purchase-receipt.png\" alt=\"Purchase Receipt\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Rejections</h3>\n\n<p>In the Purchase Receipt, you are required to enter whether all the materials you receive are of accepted quality (in case you check). If you have any rejections, update the \u201cRejected Quantity\u201d column in the Items table.</p>\n\n<p>If you reject, you are required to enter a \u201cRejected Warehouse\u201d to indicate where you are storing the rejected Items.</p>\n\n<h3>Quality Inspections</h3>\n\n<p>If for certain Items, it is mandatory to record Quality Inspections (if you have set it in your Item master), you will need to update the \u201cQuality Inspection No\u201d (QA No) column. The system will only allow you to \u201cSubmit\u201d the Purchase Receipt if you update the \u201cQuality Inspection No\u201d.</p>\n\n<h3>UOM Conversions</h3>\n\n<p>If your Purchase Order for an Item is in a different Unit of Measure (UOM) than what you stock (Stock UOM), then you will need to update the \u201cUOM Conversion Factor\u201d. See the Item settings for more information.</p>\n\n<h3>Currency Conversions</h3>\n\n<p>Since the incoming Item affects the value of your inventory, it is important to convert it into your base Currency, if you have ordered in another Currency. You will need to update the Currency Conversion Rate if applicable.</p>\n\n<h3>Taxes and Valuation</h3>\n\n<p>Some of your taxes and charges may affect your Items value. For example a Tax may not be added to your Item\u2019s valuation, because if you sell the Item, you will have to add the tax at that time. So make sure to mark all your taxes in the Taxes and Charges table correctly for accurate valuation.</p>\n\n<h3>Serial Numbers and Batches</h3>\n\n<p>If your Item is serialized or batched, you will have to enter Serial Number and Batch in the Items table. You are allowed to enter multiple Serial Numbers in one row (each on a separate line) and you must enter the same number of Serial Numbers as the quantity. You must enter each Batch number on a separate line.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4>What happens when the Purchase Receipt is \u201cSubmitted\u201d?</h4>\n\n<p>A Stock Ledger Entry is created for each Item adding the Item in the Warehouse by the \u201cAccepted Quantity\u201d\nIf you have rejections, a Stock Ledger Entry is made for each Rejection.\nThe \u201cPending Quantity\u201d is updated in the Purchase Order.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4>Adding value to your Items post Purchase Receipt:</h4>\n\n<p>Some times, certain expenses that add value to your purchased Items are known only after sometime. Common example is if you are importing the Items, you will come to know of Customs Duty etc only when your \u201cClearing Agent\u201d sends you a bill. If you want to attribute this cost to your purchased Items, you will have to use the Landed Cost Wizard. Why \u201cLanded Cost\u201d? Because it represents the charges that you paid when it landed in your possession.\f</p>\n",

   "main_section": "<p>To process Payroll in ERPNext,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create Salary Structures for all Employees.</li>\n<li>Generate Salary Slips via the Salary Manager Tool.</li>\n<li>Book the Salary in your Accounts.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Salary Structure</h3>\n\n<p>The Salary Structure represents how Salaries are calculated based on Earnings and Deductions. To create a new Salary Structure go to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>HR &gt; Salary Structure &gt; New Salary Structure</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/salary-structure.png\" alt=\"Salary Structure\" /></p>\n\n<h3>In the Salary Structure,</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Select the Employee</li>\n<li>Set the starting date from which this is valid (Note: There can only be one Salary Structure that can be \u201cActive\u201d for an Employee during any period)</li>\n<li>In the \u201cEarnings\u201d and \u201cDeductions\u201d table all your defined Earning Type and Deductions Type will be auto-populated. Set the values of the Earnings and Deductions and save the Salary Structure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Leave Without Pay (LWP)</h3>\n\n<p>Leave Without Pay (LWP) happens when an Employee runs out of allocated leaves or takes a leave without an approval (via Leave Application). If you want ERPNext to automatically deduct salary in case of LWP, then you must check on the \u201cApply LWP\u201d column in the Earning Type and Deduction Type masters. The amount of pay cut is the proportion of LWP days divided by the total working days for the month (based on the Holiday List).</p>\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t want ERPNext to manage LWP, just don\u2019t click on LWP in any of the Earning Types and Deduction Types.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Creating Salary Slips</h3>\n\n<p>Once the Salary Structure is created, you can make a salary slip from the same form or you can process your payroll for the month using the Salary Manager.</p>\n\n<p>To create a salary slip from Salary Structure, click on the button Make Salary Slip.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/salary-slip-1.png\" alt=\"Salary Slip\" /></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>Through Salary Manager:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>HR &gt; Process Payroll</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"files/salary-manager.png\" alt=\"Salary Manager\" /></p>\n\n<p>In the Salary Manager tool,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select the Company for which you want to create the Salary Slips.</li>\n<li>Select the Month and the Year for which you want to create the Salary Slips.</li>\n<li>Click on \u201cCreate Salary Slips\u201d. This will create Salary Slip records for each active Employee for the month selected. If the Salary Slips are created, the system will not create any more Salary Slips. All updates will be shown in the \u201cActivity Log\u201d section.</li>\n<li>Once all Salary Slips are created, you can check if they are created correctly or edit it if you want to deduct Leave Without Pay (LWP).</li>\n<li>After checking, you can \u201cSubmit\u201d them all together by clicking on \u201cSubmit Salary Slips\u201d. 1. If you want them to be automatically emailed to the Employee, make sure to check the \u201cSend Email\u201d box.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Booking Salaries in Accounts</h3>\n\n<p>The final step is to book the Salaries in your Accounts. </p>\n\n<p>Salaries in businesses are usually dealt with extreme privacy. In most cases, the companies issues a single payment to the bank combining all salaries and the bank distributes the salaries to each employee\u2019s salary account. This way there is only one payment entry in the company\u2019s books of accounts and anyone with access to the company\u2019s accounts will not have access to the individual salaries.</p>\n\n<p>The salary payment entry is a Journal Voucher entry that debits the total salary of all Employees to the Salary Account and credits the company\u2019s bank Account.</p>\n\n<p>To generate your salary payment voucher from the Salary Manager, click on \u201cMake Bank Voucher\u201d and a new Journal Voucher with the total salaries will be created.\f</p>\n",
