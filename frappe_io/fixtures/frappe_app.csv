We are able to track all our smartphones with serial numbers, manage billing and also use ERPNext to streamline our administration. We have loved using the ERPNext application and it has put me on top of my business. I am confident that this is the SAP and Oracle of the Bottom of the Pyramid."

Everything with the product was fine except that it just could not handle some very basic functions regarding batch manufacture, taxes, additional costs of purchase etc.. For all of these the vendor said we would have to customise at a reasonable cost which just did not fit into our scheme of things. Secondly I find ERPNext very user friendly compared with OpenBravo and OpenERP. As I keep working more on ERPNext I realise how much work you guys have put in and come out with a product that handles most of the functions without any hassles plus giving the additional option of customisation."

I have a previous experience with ORACLE E-Business suite and Microsoft Dynamics AX , but really I found ERPNext much more better than those ERPs. It is the first ERP I found users love it because of its simplicity , ease of use and speed. The product size is very small -25MB compared with 70GB from others, it doesn't exhaust server resources as others. Please continue, you will be number one within next few years. I wish you all the best, and will support you all ways."
